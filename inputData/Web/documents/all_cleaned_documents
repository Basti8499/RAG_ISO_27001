{"page_content": "\n# Who needs ISO 27001 certification?\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll walk you through the basics of the ISO 27001 certification\nand help you determine if it will serve your business goals and customers\u2019\nneeds.\u200d We\u2019ll discuss what is ISO 27001 certification and who needs ISO 27001.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## What is ISO 27001 certification?\n\n\u200d\n\nPublished by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the ISO 27001 standard helps\nbusinesses organize their people, processes, and technology. ISO 20071 was\ndesigned to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of\ninformation.\n\nThe focus of ISO 27001 standard is on a company\u2019s Information Security\nManagement System (ISMS), which outlines how they\u2019ve integrated information\nsecurity into their business processes.\n\nThe ISO 27001 standard requires companies to identify information security\nrisks to their system and the corresponding controls to address them. ISO\n27001 comprises 114 controls divided into 14 categories.\n\nThere is no requirement to implement the full list of ISO 27001\u2019s controls.\nThe ISO 27001 controls represent the possibilities for an organization to\nconsider based on its particular needs.\n\nA primary goal of ISO 27001\u2014as well as other compliance certifications such as\nSOC 2\u2014is to prove to your clients and customers that security is a top\npriority.\n\nISO 27001 is considered the global gold standard for ensuring the security of\ninformation and data. Obtaining an ISO 27001 certification can help an\norganization prove its security practices to potential customers worldwide.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## Who needs ISO 27001 certification?\n\n\u200d\n\nTo decide whether you need an ISO 27001 certification, first consider the\nregions in which your company does business: are you primarily working in\nNorth America? Are you working internationally or planning to expand your\noperations?\n\nSOC 2 is a well-known US security standard and has become a common business\npractice. If your company only performs business with US-based customers, ISO\n27001 certification may not be necessary.\n\nIf your company focuses much of its work outside of North America, ISO\ncertification may be needed. Additionally, if your clients and prospects have\nsought proof of your company\u2019s security against an internationally accepted\nstandard, then ISO 27001 certification may also be important.\n\nYour buyers are your best source of information to help you decide which\nstandard to pursue and if ISO 27001 certification is needed. If customers or\nprospects are requesting an ISO 27001 certification, then your next steps are\nclear.\n\nIf a SOC 2 meets the requirements of your customer in tandem with your own\ncompany\u2019s security and compliance needs, you\u2019ll move forward with a SOC 2\ninstead of an ISO 27001 certification.\n\nMany companies decide they eventually need both a SOC 2 and an ISO 27001\ncertification based on the demands of their growing customer base. At first,\nyour company may consider a SOC 2 and later pursue ISO 27001 as your business\nexpands.\n\n## ISO 27001 certification for various industries\n\n\u200d\n\nISO 27001 certification isn\u2019t isolated to a select field. In fact, there are\norganizations across all industries that benefit from upholding this high\nstandard of security. Some of the primary industries where we find ISO 27001\ncertification include IT, finance, telecom, healthcare, and government.\n\n\u200d\n\n### Information technology\n\nInformation is the commodity at IT and software companies, and in many cases,\nit\u2019s highly sensitive information. A company\u2019s ability to keep this data\nsecure, confidential, and proprietary is the core of its viability as a\nbusiness. These organizations also often do business worldwide, so an\ninternational standard like ISO 27001 is a high priority.\n\n\u200d\n\n### Finance\n\nThe financial industry is highly concerned with security. Currency is largely\ndigital today, so something as simple as a doctored formula or a small data\ndeletion can equate to millions or billions of dollars being \u201cmisplaced.\u201d\nWhile the finance industry is a common target for cybercrime, ISO 27001\ncompliance helps organizations stay secure and maintain the consumer trust\nthat can make them or break them.\n\n\u200d\n\n### Healthcare\n\nEssentially all the data that passes through the healthcare industry is highly\nsensitive information. In the US, HIPAA laws require certain organizations in\nthe industry to follow specific security standards, but ISO 27001 allows\nhealthcare organizations anywhere in the world to maintain and prove their\nhigh level of security.\n\n\u200d\n\n### Telecom\n\nThe telecom industry is a data superhighway, and by the same token, it can be\nan immensely profitable access point for cybercriminals. For that reason,\nsecurity is critical in the telecom industry, and the most widely accepted\nstandard these organizations turn to is ISO 27001.\n\n\u200d\n\n### Government\n\nPerhaps no industry deals with as much confidential and vital information as\nthe public sector. Governments around the world rely on ISO 27001 compliance\nto not only guide them toward a secure ecosystem but also to have a unified\nstandard that tells them other governments are thoroughly secure.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## ISO 27001 certification process and requirements overview\n\n\u200d\n\nThe 27001 certification process involves:\n\n\u200d\n\n  1. Scoping and effectively implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS)\n  2. Establishing an ISMS governing body composed of senior management and key stakeholders from throughout the company\n  3. Performing an internal audit to assess the organization\u2019s ISMS and its implementation\n  4. Undergoing an ISO audit with an external third-party auditor\n\nThe internal audit is one of the best ways to ensure that your organization\u2019s\nISMS is operating effectively and in alignment with the ISO 27001 standard.\n\nThe internal audit is required under the ISO 27001 standard and internal\nauditors must be objective and impartial. In order to make sure your ISO 27001\ncertification is up to industry standards, auditors should not be responsible\nfor implementing, operating, or monitoring any of the controls under audit.\n\nOnce the internal audit is complete, results should be shared with the\ncompany\u2019s ISMS governing body and senior management to address any issues\nbefore proceeding to the next step of the ISO 27001 certification process\u2014the\nexternal audit.\n\nThe external audit is composed of two stages. Stage 1 Audit consists of an\nextensive documentation review, during which an external ISO 27001 auditor\nreviews an organization\u2019s policies and procedures to ensure they meet the\nrequirements of the ISO standard and the organization\u2019s ISMS.\n\nStage 2 Audit consists of the auditor performing tests to ensure that an\norganization\u2019s ISMS was properly designed and implemented and is functioning\nappropriately.\n\nAn ISO 27001 certification is valid for three years, however, ISO requires\nthat surveillance audits be performed each year to ensure that the ISMS and\nits implemented controls continue to operate effectively. This means that\nevery 12 months during the 3-year cycle, an organization\u2019s ISMS must undergo\nan ISO 27001 external audit, where an auditor will assess portions of the\nISMS.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## Who benefits from ISO 27001 compliance?\n\n\u200d\n\nISO 27001 compliance offers a win-win-win situation: it benefits you, your\nstaff, and your customers in various ways.\n\nThe ISO 27001 certification benefits for your business include:\n\n  * Positioning your business as a stronger competitor so you can win more customers\n  * Protection for your intellectual property, brand, and professional reputation\n  * Retaining more of your customers\n  * Time savings and cost savings due to having more efficient processes\n  * Better security against a data breach and the associated costs like investigative costs and lawsuits\n  * Adherence to security and privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, allowing you to avoid penalties\n  * Ability to attract stronger, more security-minded staff\n\nWhen your business is ISO 27001 compliant, it offers certain benefits to your\nstaff too, such as:\n\n  * More efficient operations leading to fewer avoidable frustrations\n  * Comfort of working in a stable company that is at lower risk for financial devastation\n  * Clear and predictable policies and procedures\n\nThe biggest winners of all, though, may be your customers, who stand to gain\nseveral benefits from your ISO 27001 compliance:\n\n  * Assurance that their data will be managed safely and securely\n  * Lower risk of their data and their end users\u2019 data being exposed in a data breach\n  * More streamlined onboarding when they sign on with you as a vendor\n    ", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.vanta.com/resources/who-needs-iso-27001-certification", "title": "What is ISO 27001 Certification and Who Needs it? | Vanta", "description": "Read our blog to learn more about what is ISO 27001 certification and who needs ISO 27001.

{"page_content": "\n## How long does it take to get ISO certified?\n\n\u200d\n\nYour staff\u2019s time (or the time of contractors you hire to help with your ISO\n27001 compliance) is a limited resource, so how much time can you expect to\ndedicate to ISO 27001 certification? It varies tremendously based on your\norganization\u2019s operations and the complexity of your ISMS. In general, though,\nexpect the process to take three to twelve months. Smaller organizations that\nare committed to making this a priority can complete their readiness in closer\nto three months, some even faster.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## The ISO 27001 certification process\n\n\u200d\n\nISO 27001 certification can be a complicated process, so what can you expect\nfor the road ahead? While the specific will vary, plan on going through these\ngeneral steps.\n\n\u200d\n\n **1\\. Prepare your organization**\n\nStarting your certification process on stable footing can set the stage for a\nsmoother project all the way through, so don\u2019t look at your certification as a\nside project to work on when time allows. Appoint a staff member or a team to\nfocus on ISO 27001 certification so it is their primary focus. If they aren\u2019t\nalready an expert in ISO 27001, give them dedicated time to learn about the\nstandard and what it involves.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, an important component of ISO 27001 is assigning responsibility\nto an ISMS owner who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the standard\nand reporting to top management. Identify the owner and assign responsibility\nin order to drive the effort forward.\n\n\u200d\n\n **2\\. Determine where you stand**\n\nBefore you can start updating and fortifying your security system to meet ISO\n27001 compliance, you need to know which boxes you already check and which\nones you need to address. While some companies do this with a time-consuming\nmanual assessment, a more thorough and time-saving way is to use a compliance\nautomation software like Vanta.\n\n  \n\nVanta scans and evaluates your ISMS, comparing it against the ISO 27001\ncontrols. It gives you a clear picture of the standards you\u2019ve already met\nand, most importantly, a clear list of the controls and policies you need to\nimplement to reach the compliance level you need.\n\n\u200d\n\n **3\\. Implement the needed security controls and protocols**\n\nUsing your Vanta report as a guide, your team can now begin implementing all\nthe controls and protocols you\u2019re missing one by one. Some of these may be\nquick while others may require a project of their own, like developing\nsecurity protocols for staff to follow and training all staff members on those\nprotocols.\n\n\u200d\n\n **4\\. Re-assess your readiness**\n\nAfter you\u2019ve followed Vanta\u2019s guide and implemented the security controls you\nwere missing, it\u2019s time to check your work. Run a Vanta scan again to assess\nwhere you now stand with your compliance readiness. Ideally, it will indicate\nthat you meet all the necessary requirements so you can move ahead with the\ncertification process.\n\n\u200d\n\n **5\\. Hire a certification provider**\n\nNow that you\u2019re confident that you are compliant with all the components of\nISO 27001 that apply to your organization, it\u2019s time to begin with the\ncertification itself. The ISO does not directly provide certification for its\nstandards, so you will need to hire a third-party organization that provides\nISO 27001 certification.\n\n  \n\nNote that while the ISO doesn\u2019t provide certification, it does have a set of\nstandards that it outlines for certifying organizations. It\u2019s important to\nmake sure that the ISO Certification Body that you select is fully accredited\nin accordance with your company's requirements. Vanta has several high-\nquality, well-priced certification bodies that we can refer you to.\n\n\u200d\n\n **6\\. Perform an internal audit**\n\nIn order to obtain ISO 27001 certification, all organizations must perform an\ninternal audit of their security program. You may choose to engage a third-\nparty consultant to perform the internal audit, or a member of your\norganization, who is qualified and independent of the control owners, may\nperform the audit.\n\n\u200d\n\n **7\\. Complete a full certification audit**\n\nThis is the key piece of your ISO 27001 certification: the full audit. Your\ncertification organization will conduct an in-depth investigation of your ISMS\nto evaluate your ISO 27001 compliance. This can be an extensive on-site\nprocess.\n\n  \n\nKeep in mind, though, that compliance automation software like Vanta can make\nthis process simpler. As it scans your system, Vanta compiles and documents\nevidence of your compliance, so your auditor will have all this documentation\nin one convenient place.\n\n\u200d\n\n **8\\. Receive your certification**\n\nIf your auditor determines that you adhere to all the necessary components of\nISO 27001, you will officially receive your certification.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## Maintain your ISO 27001 certification\n\n\u200d\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that ISO 27001 certification is not a one-time\nprocess. Your certification will need to be renewed to some degree every year.\n\n  \n\nThese certificates use a three-year cycle. One year after your first\ncertification, your certification organization will conduct a less extensive\naudit to check a few key controls. If you pass this, you\u2019ll retain your\ncertification. If not, the organization will conduct a full, intensive audit\nas they did in the first year.\n\n  \n\nThe same is true for the second year after your initial certification: A brief\nassessment that retains your certification if you pass or refers you for a\nfull audit if you don\u2019t pass. The third year after your initial certification,\nyou will need to complete the full certification process again, just as you\ndid the first year. This starts the three-year cycle again.\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n## Make your ISO 27001 certification simpler\n\nISO 27001 certification will always be a significant process because it\u2019s\ndesigned to be a rigorous assessment of your information security. Still,\nusing an ISO 27001 compliance platform can make it far simpler, smoother, and\nmore cost-effective.\n    ", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.vanta.com/resources/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-iso-certified", "title": "What is the ISO certification timeline?", "description": "Need to get ISO 27001 certified?

{"page_content": "\n## What Are ISO 27001 Annex A Controls?\n\n> **Set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the\n> International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A\n> defines the 14 categories with a toal of 114 information security controls an organization can address to\n> receive and maintain its ISO 27001 certification.  **\n\nISO 27001 defines and audits these controls during stage two of the ISO 27001\ncertification process. An external accredited certification body runs a series\nof evidentiary audits that confirm the organization's technology and processes\nare correctly deployed and working properly. The auditors also confirm the\nimplemented solutions align with the controls that were declared to be in use\nby the organization during part one, the documentation review stage of the\ncertification process.  \n  \nSince industry compliance requirements, technology needs, and scope of\noperations are unique for each organization, the ISO 27001 Annex A control\nlist serves as a framework, rather than a checklist of requirements. For the\ncertification, however, each firm must draft a Statement of Applicability\n(SoA), defining the specific Annex A controls based on the company\u2019s\nidentified risks, legal and contractual requirements, and overall business\nneeds.\n\n## How Many Annex A Controls Are in ISO 27001?\n\nISO/IEC 27001 identifies 114 unique Annex A controls or safeguards in its\nframework. These cover the technology, processes, and policies an organization\nutilizes to oversee its information security management system (ISMS) and\nmaintain its security posture for personnel and third-party stakeholders.\n\n## The 14 Categories of ISO 27001 Annex A Controls  \n\nBecause a business can deploy many combinations of security controls to cover\nvarious risks and objectives, ISO divides the Annex A controls into 14 unique\nISO 27001 categories. ISO segments each category based on its scope and the\nbusiness needs it supports.  \n  \nThese are the 14 categories of ISO 27001 Annex A controls:\n\n### 1\\. Information Security Policies\n\nAnnex A.5 of ISO/IEC 27001, Information Security Policies, describes how\nleadership can provide direction and support an organization\u2019s information\nsecurity, specifically through governance. Companies can implement policies\nthat employees, contractors, and other external stakeholders need to follow to\nmaintain a strong security posture, promote their security vision, and comply\nwith laws and regulations.  \n  \nBesides outlining the processes for writing and communicating information\nsecurity policies to personnel, Annex A.5 requires organizations to conduct\nperiodic reviews to ensure those policies are still relevant based on the\norganization's current risks and regulatory requirements.  \n\n### 2\\. Organization of Information Security\n\nAnnex A.6 establishes the framework for an organization\u2019s information security\nprocesses, both for traditional and teleworking operations. It comprises\nmultiple focus areas, which include defining roles and responsibilities for\ninformation security activities while segregating duties to reduce risk.  \n  \nTechnology, processes, and policies must be in place to maintain adequate\ncontact with authorities and special interest groups, such as associations,\nindustry groups, or specialty security organizations. Additionally,\norganizations must have systems and policies for maintaining information\nsecurity for special projects outside of normal day-to-day operations while\nusing mobile devices, and during teleworking operations.  \n\n### 3\\. Human Resources Security\n\nAnnex A.7 comprises the information security controls that relate to human\nresources management before, during, and following employment. For example,\nthese controls include screening and running background checks on prospective\nemployees and implementing the terms of employment agreements.  \n  \nOrganizations use these policies to control how managers oversee employees and\ncontractors and to establish procedures for providing security awareness\neducation and training. Finally, ISO 27001 A.7 cites formal processes and\nresponsibilities for handling employee terminations and disciplinary actions.  \n\n### 4\\. Asset Management\n\nAnnex A.8 dives into identifying and protecting a firm's technology and data\nassets. ISO 27001 lists specific asset management controls that govern the\nsystems for taking inventory of assets, assigning the responsibility of\nownership for each asset, outlining and enforcing acceptable use of company\nassets, and requiring employees to return assets to the firm after use.  \n  \nAnnex A.8 also requires organizations to have policies and mechanisms for\nclassifying and labeling all managed data based on its sensitivity, value, or\nlegal requirements. In addition, companies need processes that outline how\npersonnel must handle certain assets based on how an asset is classified.\nOrganizations also need a system that enables the secure management, disposal,\nand transfer of physical or removable media.  \n\n### 5\\. Access Control\n\nAnnex A.9 is one of the largest categories on the list, with plenty of\ncontrols relating to the management of user data access and system privileges.\nFor example, businesses need to establish control policies that enforce the\nprinciple of least privilege for network and resource access. Organizations\nmust have a comprehensive system for registering, deregistering, and\nprovisioning users and for managing user rights for both standard and\nprivileged accounts.  \n  \nNext, Annex A.9 requires organizations to utilize secure controls for storing\nauthentication information, such as user credentials, and to establish\npolicies that specify which users may access credential data. User access\nrights should be reviewed ongoingly and periodic adjustments should be made\nbased on those reviews. Lastly, firms should create secure login procedures\nand password management systems and establish access control processes for\ninternal software.  \n\n### 6\\. Cryptography\n\nA short but essential category within the ISO control framework, Annex A.10\ncovers how an organization manages encryption and cryptographic controls to\nsecure its sensitive data. The first control covers setting and enforcing\norganizational policies that require users to deploy encryption under specific\ncircumstances and setting minimum cryptographic standards. Companies also need\na procedure for managing cryptographic keys and their life cycles.\n\n### 7\\. Physical and Environmental Security\n\nThe largest of the categories, Annex A.11 outlines controls to protect\norganizational assets from unauthorized access or physical damage. This\ncategory requires establishing a physical security perimeter with entry\ncontrols to secure all offices, rooms, and facilities from internal and\nexternal threats. It also emphasizes protecting physical assets from non-\ndigital risks, such as natural disasters or unauthorized entry.  \n  \nOrganizations must identify and manage risk for secured areas and delivery\nlocations. Systems should be in place for the secure installation, protection,\nmaintenance, removal, disposal, and reuse of equipment and assets\u2014even those\nlocated off-premises or unattended by users. Firms must establish clear desk\npolicies for employees and have mechanisms to secure telecommunications\ncabling and protect equipment from utility failures.\n\n### 8\\. Operational Security\n\nAnnex A.12 describes the secure management of data-processing operations. ISO\n27001 A.12 requires systems for documenting operating procedures; overseeing\nchange management; and managing operational capacity for data storage,\nprocessing power, and communications. Organizations need controls to separate\ntheir development, testing, and operating environments; back up their data;\nprotect from malware; log user and network activity.  \n  \nCompanies must secure their log information, keep system administrators\u2019\nactivity data separate from the activity data for regular users, and track all\nsystem events in a single time zone. Also, to maintain the integrity of their\noperating systems, organizations need to institute:\n\n  * Policies that allow or restrict software installation\n  * Procedures for managing system vulnerabilities\n  * Mechanisms for auditing information system controls    \n\n### 9\\. Communications Security\n\nWith a focus on managing network security, Annex A.13 looks to ensure\nbusinesses protect information both inside and outside their networks. Firms\nmust implement a system that identifies, monitors, segregates, and controls\naccess to digital resources, including applications, data, and other systems\nwithin the network.  \n  \nISO 27001 A.13 also specifically addresses the management of information\nsecurity when communicating with external sources, such as customers,\nsuppliers, and other stakeholders. Organizations need policies and procedures\nfor external information transfers, confidential agreements between the\norganization and outside users, and protection mechanisms for electronic\nmessaging.  \n\n### 10\\. System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance\n\nAnnex A.14 addresses security across all systems and life cycles, including\ndevelopment, support, and test stages. Organizations must determine\ninformation security requirements, create a method for securing applications\non public networks, and protect application service transactions. Companies\nmust have policies for secure software development, change control procedures,\nand technical reviews of applications when changes are made to operating\nplatforms.  \n  \nISO 27001 A.14 requires teams to restrict the changes employees can make to\nsoftware packages purchased from an outside vendor and limit the customization\nof open-source code. Firms should also establish and enforce secure system\nengineering principles. They must utilize secure development environments,\nproperly manage outsourced development, and have processes for security and\nacceptance testing while protecting test data.  \n\n### 11\\. Supplier Relationships\n\nAnnex A.15 discusses the control areas used to secure any assets that are\naccessible to third-party suppliers or partners. Organizations need policies\nto manage supplier relationships and address security within their service\nagreements.  \n  \nThey must also consider and address the risks associated with supply chains\nfor managed technology systems. When using data hosting centers or\ninfrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers, for instance, organizations have\nminimal control over decisions or events that could compromise data and\napplications that are managed elsewhere. Finally, organizations should\ncontinuously monitor supplier services for delivery and be prepared to handle\nservice changes.  \n\n### 12\\. Information Security Incident Management\n\nAnnex A.16 explains how an organization manages a cybersecurity or breach\nincident. Companies must establish responsibilities and incident response\nprocedures. They also need a process for reporting information security events\nand system vulnerabilities.  \n  \nAnnex A.16 requires firms to set criteria for what qualifies as an incident,\ncreate mechanisms to learn from incidents, and implement technology that helps\ncollect evidence of an incident.  \n\n### 13\\. Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity Management\n\nAnnex A.17 addresses the process of keeping operations running following an\nincident. A business should have documented and implemented business\ncontinuity plans in place. These plans explain the procedures for keeping data\nand resources available if the primary environments are shut down. The\nprocedures must be verified for effectiveness and regularly tested for\norganizational readiness.  \n\n### 14\\. Compliance\n\nFinally, Annex A.18 describes the management of legal and contractual\nobligations. Businesses must identify the applicable compliance requirements\nfor information security, understand their intellectual property rights, and\nhave systems that protect records that fall under a compliance umbrella. There\nshould be solid controls to safeguard personally identifiable information\n(PII) and deployed cryptographic technology that follows contractual and\nregulatory requirements across all territories.  \n  \nThe compliance and information security evaluation component of Annex A.18\noutlines that firms should obtain independent, third-party reviews of their\ninformation security risks and controls and of their adherence to compliance\nrequirements. Organizations must also perform internal evaluations to ensure\ncompliance with their own security policies and procedures, as well as conduct\ntechnical reviews of internal software, security technology, and other\ninformation systems.  \n\n## How to Decide Which ISO 27001 Controls to Implement\n\nDeciding which Annex A controls to implement is a crucial step that determines\nwhether an organization becomes ISO 27001 certified. To assess their SoA for\nimplementing controls, firms must consider various factors, such as their\nindustry, operations model, IT environment, organizational size, technology\nstack, and information-security risks.  \n  \nFor example, if a healthcare facility is seeking compliance certification for\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) through the\nHealth Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST), the organization will need a\ncomprehensive system for each control area defined in the Compliance category.  \n  \nThe Supplier Relationships category will be relevant only to organizations\nthat work with suppliers. Likewise, the Physical and Environmental Security\ncategory will be irrelevant to a business that works remotely and relies\nsolely on cloud-based applications; however, that organization will need to\nimplement comprehensive controls in the Access Control and Communications\nSecurity categories.  \n\n## Who Should Implement ISO 27001 Controls?\n\nBecause the ISO 27001 control categories cover a wide range of business\nfunctions, personnel from different areas of the organization will need to\ncollaborate during the ISO implementation process. If ISO 27001 is to be\nimplemented by an in-house team, a dedicated ISO 27001 lead must oversee the\nentire operation.  \n  \nSpecific ISO 27001 control categories require certain roles to provide input\nand complete specific tasks. For example,\n\n  * A human resources director will manage some of the Human Resource Security activities, such as running background checks on candidates. \n  * An in-house attorney will draft specific organizational policies across the various Annex A categories. \n  * An IT manager will install software to protect network assets and endpoints relevant to the categories that require software controls to improve security.        \n\nAlternatively, companies can opt to invest in outside consultants who will\nhelp implement the ISO 27001 controls list. While individual departments\nwithin the organization will still need to be involved, a dedicated contractor\nwith ISO 27001 experience can bring skills, resources, and an outside\nperspective that an in-house lead often lacks.\n\n## How to Implement ISO 27001 Controls\n\nThe checklist for implementing ISO 27001 controls starts with assigning and\ncoordinating with all the personnel involved in the process, including human\nresources, legal, supplier relations, IT management, DevOps, and cybersecurity\ndepartment representatives. The next step is to establish the organization\u2019s\nSoA by running risk assessments and thoroughly reviewing the 114 ISO 27001\nsecurity controls to determine which areas apply to the business's\noperational, technology, and compliance needs.  \n  \nOnce those control requirements are determined, firms should run a gap\nanalysis to compare the controls necessary for the organization to those\nalready implemented in their current ISMS. Based on the gaps, they can\nimplement the new controls by updating company policies, hiring personnel,\ndeveloping new processes, and purchasing new technology to upgrade the ISMS.  \n  \nAfter implementing the new security systems, organizations must train\npersonnel in the operations of the new controls. Finally, once everything is\nin place, they start the ISO 27001 certification process by conducting an\ninternal audit.  \n    ", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.strongdm.com/blog/iso-27001-controls", "title": "Understanding ISO 27001 Controls [Guide to Annex A] | StrongDM", "description": "Set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A defines the 114...", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n# How to Implement ISO 27001: A 9-Step Guide\n\n## 1\\. Assemble an ISO 27001 implementation team\n\nThe implementation project should begin by appointing a project leader, who\nwill work with other members of staff to create a project mandate. This is\nessentially a set of answers to these questions:\n\n  * What are we hoping to achieve? \n  * How long will it take? \n  * What will it cost? \n  * Does it have management support? \n\n## 2\\. Develop the ISO 27001 implementation plan\n\nThe next step is to use your project mandate to create a more detailed outline\nof your information security objectives, plan and risk register.\n\nThis includes setting out high-level policies for the ISMS that establish:\n\n  * Roles and responsibilities; \n  * Rules for its continual improvement; and \n  * How to raise awareness of the project through internal and external communication. \n\n## 3\\. ISMS initiation\n\nNow it\u2019s time to adopt a methodology for implementing the ISMS. The Standard\nrecognises that a \u201cprocess approach\u201d to continual improvement is the most\neffective model for managing information security.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t specify a particular methodology, and instead allows\norganisations to use whatever method they choose, or to continue with a model\nthey already have in place.\n\nPart of this process involves developing the rest of your document structure.\nWe recommend using a four-tier strategy:\n\n  * Policies at the top, defining the organisation\u2019s position on specific issues, such as acceptable use and password management. \n  * Procedures to enact the policies\u2019 requirements. \n  * Work instructions describing how employees should meet those policies. \n  * Records tracking the procedures and work instructions.\n\n## 4\\. Management framework\n\nAt this stage, you need to gain a broader understanding of the ISMS\u2019s\nframework. The process for doing this is outlined in clauses 4 and 5 of the\nISO 27001 standard.\n\nThe most important part of this process is defining the scope of your ISMS \u2013\ni.e. which parts of your organisation you\u2019ll be protecting. Creating an\nappropriate scope is an essential part of your ISMS implementation project.\n\nIf your scope is too small, then you leave information exposed, jeopardising\nthe security of your organisation, but if it\u2019s too large, your ISMS will\nbecome too complex to manage.\n\n## 5\\. Baseline security controls\n\nAn organisation\u2019s security baseline is the minimum level of activity required\nto conduct business securely.\n\nYou should define your security baseline using the information collected\nduring your ISO 27001 risk assessment.\n\n## 6\\. Risk management\n\nRisk management is a core part of any ISMS. After all, it\u2019s no good\nidentifying and prioritising information security threats if you\u2019re unable to\ndeal with them effectively.\n\nThis stage isn\u2019t about managing risks themselves but establishing how you\u2019ll\napproach the task. There are several ways you can do this, but most methods\ninvolve looking at risks to specific assets or risks presented in specific\nscenarios.\n\nHowever you go about the task, the risk assessment process is crucial. After\nidentifying, evaluating and assigning values to your threats, you\u2019ll know\nwhich risks pose the biggest problem.\n\nYou should take those and determine whether to:\n\n  * Treat the risk by applying information security controls laid out in ISO 27001; \n  * Terminate the risk by avoiding it entirely;\n  * Share the risk (with an insurance policy or via an agreement with other parties); or\n  * Accept the risk (if it doesn\u2019t pose a significant threat).\n\nAny risks that you treat should be documented in an SoA (Statement of\nApplicability). This should explain which of the Standard\u2019s controls you\u2019ve\nselected and omitted and why you made those choices.\n\n## 7\\. Implement the risk treatment plan\n\nNow it\u2019s time to implement your risk treatment plan. To ensure these controls\nare effective, you will need to check that staff are able to operate or\ninteract with the controls, and that they are aware of their information\nsecurity obligations.\n\nYou will also need to develop a process to determine, review and maintain the\ncompetences necessary to achieve your ISMS objectives.\n\nThis involves conducting a needs analysis and defining a desired level of\ncompetence.\n\n## 8\\. Measure, monitor and review\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to tell if your ISMS is working or not unless you review it.\nWe recommend doing this at least annually, so that you can keep track of the\nway risks evolve and identify new threats.\n\nThe main objective of the review process is to see whether your ISMS is in\nfact preventing security incidents, but the process is more nuanced than that.\n\nYou should be comparing its output to the objectives you laid out in the\nproject mandate \u2013 i.e. what you hoped to achieve. These can be measured\nquantitatively and qualitatively.\n\nQuantitative assessments are useful for measuring things that involve\nfinancial costs or time, whereas qualitative assessments are better suited for\nobjectives that are hard to define, like your employees\u2019 satisfaction with new\nprocesses, for example.\n\n## 9\\. Certification\n\nOnce the ISMS is in place, organisations should consider seeking certification\nfrom an accredited certification body.\n\nThis proves to stakeholders that the ISMS is effective and that the\norganisation understands the importance of information security.\n\nThe certification process will involve a review of the organisation\u2019s\nmanagement system documentation to check that the appropriate controls have\nbeen implemented. The certification body will also conduct a site audit to\ntest the procedures in practice.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/a-9-step-guide-to-implementing-iso-27001", "title": "How to Implement ISO 27001: A 9-Step Guide - IT Governance Blog En", "description": "ISO 27001 explains the compliance requirements you need to meet, but it doesn\u2019t show you how to implement them.\u00a0This blog fills in what you need to know", "language": "en-GB"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n# 5 Benefits of ISO 27001 Certification\n\n## **1\\. It will protect your reputation from security threats**\n\nThe most obvious reason to certify to ISO 27001 is that it will help you avoid\nsecurity threats. This includes both cyber criminals breaking into your\norganisation and data breaches caused by internal actors making mistakes.\n\nISO 27001\u2019s framework ensures that you have the tools in place to strengthen\nyour organisation across the three pillars of cyber security: people,\nprocesses and technology.\n\nYou can use the Standard to identify the relevant policies you need to\ndocument, the technologies to protect you and the staff training to avoid\nmistakes.\n\n## **2\\. You\u2019ll avoid regulatory fines**\n\nISO 27001 helps organisations to avoid the costly penalties associated with\nnon-compliance with data protection requirements such as the GDPR (General\nData Protection Regulation).\n\nIndeed, the Standard\u2019s framework has much in common with the GDPR, and\norganisations can use its guidelines to achieve and maintain compliance.\n\nBut the GDPR isn\u2019t the only framework that ISO 27001 can help you with. Its\nbest-practice approach to information security means it is a suitable starting\npoint for any number of regulations.\n\n## **3\\. It will protect your reputation**\n\nBy achieving ISO 27001 compliance, you can demonstrate to stakeholders that\nyou take information security seriously.\n\nThis will help you win new business and enhance your reputation with existing\nclients and customers. In fact, some organisations will only work with\norganisations that can demonstrate that they have certified to ISO 27001.\n\nCyber attacks are on the increase in across Europe and the rest of the world,\nand can have a massive impact on your organisation and its reputation. An ISO\n27001-certified ISMS (information security management system) helps protect\nyour organisation and keeps you out of the headlines.\n\n## **4\\. It will improve your structure and focus**\n\nAs organisations adapt and grow, it won\u2019t take long before people lose sight\nof their responsibilities regarding information security.\n\nWith ISO 27001, you can create a system that has enough flexibility to ensure\nthat everyone maintains their focus on information security tasks. Similarly,\nit requires organisations to conduct annual risk assessments, which help you\nmake changes where necessary.\n\n## **5\\. It reduces the need for frequent audits**\n\nISO 27001 certification is globally accepted and demonstrates effective\nsecurity, reducing the need for repeat customer audits.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/benefits-of-iso-27001-certification", "title": "5 Benefits of ISO 27001 Certification - IT Governance Blog En", "description": "The benefits of ISO 27001 certification demonstrates to customers that you have taken the necessary steps to protect your business.", "language": "en-GB"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n# Why Are So Many Organisations Certifying to ISO 27001?\n\nData breaches and cyber attacks are, unfortunately, becoming a regular\noccurrence. According to research from the Identify Theft Resource Center,\nthere were 1,864 security incidents in 2021.\n\nThat\u2019s a 68% increase over the previous year, and as organisations become\nincreasingly reliant on technology, the number of incidents will continue to\nrise unless information security is sufficiently prioritised.\n\nOrganisations that have already certified to ISO 27001 understand the benefits\nof the framework, but for everyone else, it\u2019s true potential is yet to be\nseen.\n\n### **How ISO 27001 helps**\n\nISO 27001 sets out a best-practice approach to cyber risk management that can\nbe adopted by all businesses, large or small.\n\nThe Standard outlines three essential aspects or \u2018pillars\u2019 of effective\ninformation security: people, processes and technology.\n\nThis three-pronged approach helps organisations defend themselves from both\nhighly organised attacks and common internal threats, such as accidental\nbreaches and human error.\n\nISO 27001 certification brings a wealth of benefits. For example, it helps\norganisations:\n\n  * Avoid penalties and financial losses due to data breaches.\n  * Meet increasing client demands for greater data security.\n  * Protect and enhance your reputation.\n  * Get independently audited proof that your data is secure.\n\nPlus, as organisations look to address their wider information security\nrequirements, there is the small matter of the GDPR (General Data Protection\nRegulation) to contend with. Again, ISO 27001 can help.\n\nIts framework overlaps with the GDPR in several places, most notably in\nArticle 32, which states that organisations must:\n\n  * Take measures to pseudonymise and encrypt personal data.\n  * Ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services.\n  * Restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.\n  * Implement a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures.\n\nArticle 32 also mandates that organisations address risks that could lead to\nthe \u201caccidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised\ndisclosure of, or access to personal data\u201d.\n\nAn effective ISMS (information security management system) that conforms to\nISO 27001 will meet all these requirements. This ensures that organisations\ncomply with the GDPR in the most efficient way possible, with their compliance\npractices embedded within their overall information security measures.\n\n### **A new standard**\n\nA new version of ISO 27001 was published in October, introducing several\nadjustments in the way organisations are expected to manage information\nsecurity.\n\nThere are new requirements related to planned changes and how organisations\nshould deal with them, as well as a greater focus on the needs and\nexpectations of interested parties.\n\nHowever, the most significant differences in ISO 27001:2022 relate to its\nstructure. There is new terminology, the 14 clauses are gone and the total\nnumber of controls has decreased from 114 to 93.\n\nIf organisations going to maintain ISO 27001 compliance after the transition\nperiod, they need to understand how these changes affect them and the steps\nthey must take to meet their requirements.\n\nWith the Standard only being a few months old, there is little guidance on how\nthe new requirements will affect organisations and the best way to implement\nthe changes.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/why-are-so-many-organisations-getting-certified-to-iso-27001", "title": "Why Are So Many Organisations Certifying to ISO 27001? - IT Governance Blog En", "language": "en-GB"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n# What You Need to Know About ISO 27001:2022\n\nAs you might now know, a new version of ISO 27001 was published last year,\nbeginning a transition period that will reshape the way organisations are\nexpected to manage information security.\n\nISO 27001 was previously updated in 2013 \u2013 almost a decade ago \u2013 and with ISO\n27001:2022, significant changes have been made that bring the Standard into\nline with modern business practices.\n\n## **What\u2019s different in ISO 27001:2022?**\n\nISO 27001 contains several new requirements. For example, there are new rules\non planned changes and how organisations should deal with them, plus there is\na greater focus on the needs and expectations of interested parties.\n\nMeanwhile, Annex A of ISO 27001 now refers to the updated information security\ncontrols in ISO 27002:2022 (which was published earlier this year), and the\nStandard requires organisations to document and monitor their objectives.\n\nThere are also changes in the terminology used. The latest version of the\nStandard aligns its phrasing with the language used across other ISO\nmanagement standards, while ISO 27002:2022 is no longer referred to as a \u201ccode\nof practice\u201d. This better reflects its purpose as a reference set of\ninformation security controls.\n\nOther major changes relate to the structure of ISO 27002. It no longer\nconsists of 14 control categories (often referred to as \u2018clauses\u2019), and is\ninstead split into four \u2018themes\u2019: organisational, people, physical and\ntechnological.\n\nAs part of this change, the total number of controls has decreased from 114 to\n93. This is because many controls have been reordered and merged, while 11\ncompletely new requirements have been added. These are:\n\n  * Threat intelligence\n  * Information security for use of cloud services\n  * ICT readiness for business continuity\n  * Physical security monitoring\n  * Configuration management\n  * Information deletion\n  * Data masking\n  * Data leakage prevention\n  * Monitoring activities\n  * Web filtering\n  * Secure coding\n\nThe new and amended controls are also categorised according to five types of\n\u2018attribute\u2019: control type, operational capabilities, security domains,\ncybersecurity concepts and information security properties.\n\nThis change is intended to make it easier to highlight and view all controls\nof a certain type, such as all preventive controls, or all controls related to\nconfidentiality.\n\n## **What organisations must do now**\n\nOrganisations that have already certified their ISMS (information security\nmanagement system) to ISO 27001:2013 have until 31 October 2025 to conform to\nISO 27001:2022.\n\nHowever, according to the IAF\u2019s (International Accreditation Forum) revised\nguidance document, certification bodies must stop offering (re)certification\nto the 2013 edition of the Standard by 30 April 2024, so there may be less\ntime to conform to ISO 27001:2022 than you thought.\n\nMoreover, even if your organisation\u2019s ISMS is recertified to ISO 27001:2013 by\n30 April 2024, that certificate will expire on 31 October 2025 \u2013 even if it\nhas been in place for less than three years (the normal duration of an ISO\nmanagement system certificate).\n\nWe therefore advise you start adopting the 2022 Standard as soon as you can.\n\nIndeed, the reason that the new version of ISO 27001 was published last year\nis so that organisations can familiarise themselves with the new controls\nbefore embarking on an implementation project.\n\nFortunately, ISO 27002:2022 contains an annex that compares its controls with\nthe 2013 version. As such, the process should relatively straightforward if\nyou are already certified to the current iteration.\n\nThe best way to get started is to read a copy of the new standard for yourself\nand comparing it to the 2013 version and your current compliance practices.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/what-you-need-to-know-about-iso-270012022", "title": "What You Need to Know About ISO 27001:2022 | IT Governance EU", "description": "The new version of ISO 27001 has been published, starting a transition period that will reshape the way organisations are to manage information security.", "language": "en-GB"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n# How ISO 27001 Can Boost Your Cloud Security\n\nOrganisations are increasingly dependent on Cloud services. According to a\nreport by the software firm Flexera, 92% of organisations use more than one,\nwith the average respondent using 2.6 public Clouds and 2.7 private ones.\n\nThere are obvious benefits of this, from greater accessibility to automation\nand synchronisation.\n\nHowever, many people believe that using a Cloud storage provider will boost\ntheir cyber security posture \u2013 and although there\u2019s some truth to that, it\ndoesn\u2019t present the whole picture.\n\nAfter all, information stored in the Cloud is still held in a physical\nlocation, and if it\u2019s accessible to you, that means it could also be\naccessible to cyber criminals.\n\nTo truly protect data stored in the Cloud, you must take the same kinds of\nprecautions as you would with information held elsewhere. That means\nimplementing appropriate controls based on the framework outlined in ISO\n27001, the international standard that describes best practice for an ISMS\n(information security management system).\n\nIn this blog, we look at three ways that ISO 27001 can help protect\ninformation stored in the Cloud.\n\n## **Antivirus software**\n\nThe Cloud, like any database that\u2019s accessible via the Internet, is\nsusceptible to malware attacks.\n\nThese can come in any form, including worms, adware, keyloggers and\nransomware. The only way to consistently detect them is with antivirus and\nanti-malware technology.\n\nAnnex A.12.2 of ISO 27001 addresses malware prevention \u2013 and the obvious\nstarting point is anti-malware software.\n\nThese are some of the most common cyber security tools on the market, so you\nshouldn\u2019t have any problem finding a suitable package. The likes of Norton,\nBitdefender and Kaspersky all offer services, differentiating themselves\nthrough additional features.\n\nBitdefender, for example, stands out for its ability to detect ransomware,\nwhereas F-Secure is one of the few services that can be used on Apple devices.\n\n## **Staff awareness**\n\nThere is more to malware prevention than threat detection. Annex A.12.2 notes\nadditional steps that organisations can take to ensure that vulnerabilities\nare addressed promptly and that employees don\u2019t make mistakes that could allow\nmalware to enter the organisation\u2019s systems.\n\nOne way to do that is by implementing a vulnerability patch programme to\nensure that updates are applied promptly.\n\nOrganisations should also test the effectiveness of those patches to guarantee\nthe continued availability and integrity of information, while minimising\nincompatibilities.\n\nStaff awareness training plays a crucial part in this process. Employees\nshould be educated on the importance of patch management and be given\nguidelines on the steps they must follow.\n\nAdditionally, malware infection most commonly happens via phishing emails. As\nsuch, organisations should conduct regular staff awareness training to help\nemployees spot suspicious emails and report them where appropriate.\n\n## **Information backup**\n\nAnother control that helps with Cloud security can be found in Annex A.12.3.\nIt explains that organisations should back up sensitive information in case\nthat data is compromised.\n\nOrganisations often mistakenly think that the Cloud is itself a backup,\nbecause it will be safe in the event that anything happens to the servers\nowned by the organisation.\n\nHowever, Cloud servers are also vulnerable to compromise, so organisations\nmust maintain copies of valuable information in multiple locations.\n\nBackup regimes should be designed according to each organisation\u2019s\nrequirements and risk levels relating to the availability of information.\nOrganisations should also test their backups regularly to make sure that\ninformation can be restored fully and without corruption.\n\n## **Remote working**\n\nThe increase in remote working amid the pandemic is one of the main motivators\nbehind the increase in Cloud storage. With employees spread across the country\n\u2013 or in some cases across the globe \u2013 organisations need a central location\nthat allows employees to access information.\n\nHowever, remote working introduces security risks related to the access of\ninformation. Annex A.6.2.2 of ISO 27001 contains guidelines to address these\nrisks, focusing on mobile devices and teleworking.\n\nBy creating policies around these, organisations can set rules for who can\naccess, store and process information in the Cloud while working remotely.\n\nMost organisations should have access controls on their internal systems to\nensure that information is only viewable to certain members of staff. Doing so\nreduces the risk of insider threats, and mitigates the damage should a cyber\ncriminal compromise an employee\u2019s account.\n\nSimilar measures must be applied to Cloud systems. Sometimes this is as simple\nlimited access to Cloud databases \u2013 but you might find that there is\ninformation within those systems that needs to be further restricted.\n\nDepending on the service you use, it might have in-build access controls that\nthe administrator can adjust accordingly. On other occasions, though, the\norganisation might be required to establish access controls on its end.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/how-iso-27001-can-boost-your-cloud-security", "title": "How ISO 27001 Can Boost Your Cloud Security - IT Governance Blog En", "description": "With the growing popularity of Cloud services, organisations should consider the benefits of the information security standard ISO 27001.", "language": "en-GB"}, "type": "Document"}

This method helps\norganizations recognize internal and external challenges or threats, and\nidentify gaps for remediation. The **Plan** phase is an organization\u2019s\nopportunity to establish the context and scope of its ISMS. In the **Do**\nphase, an organization implements its ISMS policies, controls, processes, and\nprocedures, including a risk assessment and treatment plan. The **Check**\nphase involves an organization\u2019s work to monitor, measure, analyze, and\nevaluate the ISMS and its implementation. The **Act** phase is the\norganization\u2019s opportunity to take corrective and preventive action based on\nthe results of its ISMS internal audit and management review.\n\nThe ISO 27001 standard engages a risk-based approach to information security,\nrequiring organizations to identify information security risks pertinent to\ntheir organization and the space in which they operate, and to select the\nappropriate controls to address those risks. The full standard provides a wide\nrange of controls that an organization can utilize to ensure that its approach\nto information security is comprehensive and well-suited to the organization.\nThe standard is applicable to organizations of any size or type.\n\nISO 27001 is considered the global gold standard for ensuring the security\nof information and supporting assets. Obtaining ISO 27001 certification can\nhelp an organization prove its security practices to potential customers\nanywhere in the world.\n\n\n## What is an Information Security Management System (ISMS)?\nAn Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a documented management\nsystem made up of security requirements and controls. A company can\ndemonstrate its implementation of and conformance with their ISMS through\ntheir policies, procedures, and operational processes. The ISO 27001 standard\ndefines which documents must exist at a minimum.\n\nAn ISMS provides a structured approach to integrating information security\ninto an organization\u2019s business processes\u2014thus helping to effectively manage\nand minimize risks, increase the organization\u2019s resiliency, and ensure the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational and customer\ninformation.\n\n\n## How much does ISO 27001 certification cost, how long will it take, and how\nlong is it valid?\nMuch like the process of going through a SOC 2 audit, the cost of obtaining\nISO 27001 certification varies depending on organization size and number of\nemployees, which in turn helps determine the time it will take to audit the\norganization. **ISO 27001 certification costs can range from $6K\u2013$10K for\nsmaller companies, to upwards of $25K for large companies.**\n\nDepending on the size of an organization, implementation of an ISMS based on\nISO 27001 can be complex, involving a variety of activities and people; the\nproject can last for several months\u2014or as long as a year or more. Employing a\nstructured approach and a clearly defined scope of work\u2014including what is to\nbe done, who is responsible for executing various tasks, and the time frame\nfor completion\u2014will position your company to succeed at ISO 27001\nimplementation in a timely and manageable fashion.\n\nYour ISO 27001 certification is valid for three years, which means that every\nthree years you will be required to perform a full ISO 27001 audit. However,\nISO requires that surveillance audits be performed in the second and third\nyears of the Certification Cycle to ensure that your ISMS and the implemented\ncontrols continue to operate effectively. In those years, your organization\u2019s\nISMS must undergo an external audit, where an auditor will assess portions of\nyour ISMS. Once your ISMS is implemented, it is important to ensure\nappropriate maintenance and continual improvement of the in-scope ISMS\u2014or you\nrun the risk of failing your surveillance audit and losing your ISO\ncertification.\n\nInformation security management does not stop once your company has achieved\nits ISO 27001 certification. ISO 27001 can grow and evolve with your business,\nhelping to ensure that your information stays secure no matter how much it\nchanges, and as new security threats emerge.\n\n\n## How to approach ISO 27001 as an org-wide project\nImplementing ISO 27001 into an organization should be treated as a formal\norganizational project that includes senior management and stakeholder\nsupport, appropriate resource allocation, and efficient and effective\ncommunication. While this may seem intuitive, the challenge inherent in\nsuccessfully creating and maintaining a truly organization-wide project is one\nof the reasons that ISO implementations may fail.\n\nMany organizations treat ISO 27001 implementation as an information security\nor information technology task, solely the responsibility of those departments\nor teams. While those teams are significant stakeholders, implementation of\nISO 27001 impacts multiple facets of an organization, and as such requires an\norganizational approach with organizational buy-in and support.\n\nA critical part of implementing an ISMS that meets the ISO 27001 standard is\nestablishing the ISMS governing body: a governance team with management\noversight, incorporating key members of top management from within the\norganization. While organizational size and structure varies, \u201ctop management\u201d\nis typically defined as senior leadership and executive management that are\nresponsible for strategic decisions and resource allocation within an\norganization. \n\nThe primary objective of the ISMS governing body is to provide appropriate\nmanagement oversight for the organization\u2019s ISMS, and to ensure that:\n  * Information security objectives are in alignment with the business strategy in order to help meet the organization\u2019s strategic objectives.\n  * A risk management program that identifies and mitigates the risks to an organization\u2019s resources and assets is in place and producing the intended results.\n  * Policies and procedures that support the organization\u2019s ISMS are reviewed, approved, and remain current.\n  * Resources are appropriately allocated, and effectively, and efficiently used in order to meet the intended objectives.\n  * An internal audit program is defined and carried out in accordance with established policies and procedures, to include sufficient independence to maintain a separation of duties and avoid any conflicts of interest.\n  * Metrics such as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are defined, useful, and are being reported to ensure that the ISMS is effective and intended outcomes are achieved.\n  * Any necessary adjustments are made to continually improve the ISMS. \n\n\n## What are the requirements of ISO 27001 and an effective ISMS?\n### Scope development\nSetting the scope of your organization\u2019s ISMS is an essential step in\nestablishing an effective ISMS. The scope will inform stakeholders what areas\nof the business are covered by the ISMS. As your organization defines the\nscope of its ISMS, you will also designate which areas are out of scope.\n\nThe scope of your organization\u2019s ISMS can be as small or as large as you want\nto design it; the ISMS can cover a small part of your organization, such as a\nspecific function or service, or the entire organization. In any\nimplementation, it is necessary that the scope is clearly defined and includes\nall boundaries as well as internal and external context relevant to the scope,\nand that all the requirements from ISO 27001, as well as the applicable\nrequirements from Annex A of ISO 27001, are applied and operational within the\nISMS.\n\nSome key considerations for organizations thinking through the scope and\ndesign of their ISMS:\n  * The design and adoption of an ISMS is not exclusively an IT or information security decision. It is a strategic business decision that needs to support the strategic objectives of the organization, and should involve top management and key internal stakeholders (more on this later in this guide).\n  * The ISMS should be agile, as it will need to evolve in response to changes within the business, the threat landscape, and any associated risks posed to the organization.\n  * Areas outside of the scope of the ISMS are inherently less trustworthy, due to the lack of oversight and risk mitigation activities. Therefore, additional consideration and security controls may be needed for any business processes that are required to pass information that is protected and governed by the ISMS across the trust boundary.\n  * The interfaces and dependencies between activities performed by your organization and other organizations that are critical to business processes and services\u2014such as vendors and service providers\u2014are considered to be in scope for the ISMS.\n\n### Asset identification\nIn order to build an effective ISMS and achieve ISO 27001 compliance,\norganizations must create an inventory of their information assets. The\ncurrent version of the ISO 27001 standard expects all information assets to be\nconsidered, including anything of value to the organization where information\nis stored, processed, and accessible. This includes the consideration of\nphysical assets such as laptops, servers, and physical building locations, as\nwell as information assets such as data, people, and intangible assets like\nintellectual property, brand, and reputation. An auditor will expect to see an\nasset inventory that includes all relevant assets within the scope of the\nISMS. Each asset must have a classification and an owner who is responsible\nfor ensuring that assets are inventoried, correctly classified and protected,\nand correctly handled when being deleted or destroyed; the owner must also\nensure that asset access restrictions and classifications are periodically\nreviewed. Asset owners are responsible for setting protection requirements for\nthe asset according to organizational policies and standards.\n\n### Execute a risk assessment\nThe purpose of the risk assessment is to help organizations identify, analyze,\nand evaluate weaknesses in their information security processes and\nprocedures. A successful risk assessment process will help your organization:\n  * Identify and understand specific scenarios in which information, systems, or services could be compromised or affected\n  * Determine the likelihood or probable frequency with which these scenarios could occur\n  * Evaluate the impact each scenario could cause to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information, systems, and services\n  * Rank risk scenarios based on overall risk to the organization\u2019s objectives\n\nIn order to ensure an effective risk assessment, you will need to establish a\nrisk management framework. This framework should be documented in the form of\na policy or procedure to ensure a consistent methodology is used when\nanalyzing, communicating, and treating risks.\n\n### Develop a risk treatment plan\nAfter completion of a risk assessment, your company will be positioned to\ndevelop a risk treatment plan documenting your response plan, including the\nactions that will be taken to address each risk identified during the\nassessment process. When determining how to respond to an identified risk,\ncompanies are faced with four typical options: acceptance, mitigation,\ntransfer, and avoidance. A risk treatment plan will typically contain the\nfollowing elements:\n  * A summary of each of the identified risks\n  * Responses that have been designed for each risk \n  * Assigned risk owner to each identified risk, who is accountable for their respective risks\n  * Assigned risk mitigation activity owners, or those responsible for performing the tasks required to address the identified risks\n  * Target completion date for when determined risk treatment activities are to be completed\n\nYour company will subsequently determine which controls to implement in order\nto help address identified risks. Annex A of ISO 27001 provides an ideal\nstarting point; it contains 114 controls, divided into 14 sections, each\ntailored to a specific aspect of information security. When selecting controls\nfrom Annex A, your company will want to begin filling out the Statement of\nApplicability (SoA), which is a list of all of the Annex A controls, including\njustification for inclusion or exclusion of each control as part of the\norganization\u2019s ISMS implementation.\n\n### Complete the Statement of Applicability (SoA)\nThe Statement of Applicability (SoA) is a fundamental part of your\norganization\u2019s ISMS. Not only is this one of the most important documents that\nyou will need to develop for the ISO 27001 certification, but since it\ncontains a list of recommended controls to help mitigate identified risk, it\nis also one of the most suitable documents to help obtain management support\nfor the implementation of the ISMS. The Statement of Applicability, along with\nthe scope document, is one of the first documents that an auditor will review\nas part of the audit process. The Statement of Applicability helps your\nauditor understand your organization, as well as what controls have been\nimplemented and must be assessed as part of your audit.\n\n### Create an ISMS Information Security Policy (ISMS Policy)\nThe ISMS Information Security Policy is the highest-level internal document in\nyour ISMS. It should provide a framework to be applied when establishing,\nimplementing, maintaining, and continually improving the ISMS, and should\ninclude substantial information for, or make general statements with\nappropriate references to, supporting documentation regarding the following:\n  * Information Security Objectives\n  * Leadership and Commitment\n  * Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities\n  * Approach to Assessing and Treating Risk\n  * Control of Documented Information\n  * Communication\n  * Internal Audit\n  * Management Review\n  * Corrective Action and Continual Improvement\n  * Policy Violations\n\nYour organization will also need to create supplemental policies and\nprocedures to support the requirements outlined in ISO 27001 for the ISMS as\nwell as the Annex A controls.\n\n### ISO 27001: The internal audit\nBefore undergoing an ISO audit with an external auditor, your company will\nfirst be required to perform an internal audit. An internal audit involves a\nthorough examination of your organization\u2019s ISMS and is one of the best ways\nto ensure that your organization\u2019s ISMS is operating effectively and is in\nalignment with the ISO 27001 standard. Specifically, organizations are\nrequired to self-verify conformance with the requirements from Annex A of ISO\n27001 deemed applicable in the ISMS's documented Statement of Applicability.\nThe internal audit is intended to help identify any gaps or deficiencies that\ncould affect your ISMS and impact your organization\u2019s ability to meet its\nintended objectives, as well as to successfully complete an initial or annual\nISO 27001 certification audit and maintain the certification.\n\n **The internal audit function is a requirement under the ISO 27001 standard**\nand can be challenging to implement in a way that meets each of the\nrequirements set forth in the standard, especially for smaller organizations.\nThis is because of the prescriptive nature outlined in the standard, and the\nneed for allocated resources that are both independent of the development and\nmaintenance of the ISMS, while still possessing the necessary competencies to\nperform the internal audit function.\n\n**Unlike a certification review where you must use an external third-party to\nconduct the audit, the internal audit can be conducted either by staff within\nyour organization or by an independent third party, such as a consulting\nfirm.** When determining your approach to execution of an internal audit, your\ncompany must:\n  * Ensure that the auditor is objective and impartial, meaning that there are no conflicts of interest and that appropriate separation of duties are in place (i.e. the auditor has not implemented or does not operate or monitor any of the controls under audit).\n  * Ensure that the auditor is qualified and competent regarding auditing processes and procedures, as well as the ISO 27001 standard.\n\nThe results of the internal audit, including nonconformities, should be shared\nwith your company\u2019s ISMS governing body and senior management to ensure proper\noversight and to ensure that any identified issues can be appropriately\naddressed.\n\n\u200d### ISO 27001: The external audit, in two stages\nThe external ISO certification process is divided into a Stage 1 Audit and a\nStage 2 Audit.\n\nThe Stage 1 Audit consists of an extensive documentation review in which an\nexternal ISO 27001 auditor reviews an organization\u2019s policies and procedures\nto ensure they meet the requirements of the ISO standard and the\norganization\u2019s ISMS. At the completion of the Stage 1 audit, the auditor will\nprovide feedback outlining whether the organization is ready to move to the\nStage 2 audit. **If the auditor determines that the ISMS fails to meet the\nrequirements of the ISO 27001 standard, the auditor will typically outline\nareas of concern over which the certifying organization must demonstrate\n\nThe Stage 2 audit\u2014also known as the Main or Certification audit\u2014is the second\nstage in the ISO certification audit process and follows successful completion\nof the Stage 1 audit. The Stage 2 Audit consists of the auditor performing\ntests to ensure that your ISMS was properly designed and implemented and is\nfunctioning appropriately; the auditor will also evaluate the fairness and\nsuitability of your controls and will determine if the controls have been\nimplemented and are operating effectively to meet the ISO standard\nrequirements.\n\n### Management Review\nSenior management within an organization is ultimately responsible for the\nsuccess of the organization\u2019s ISMS. In order for senior management to ensure\nthat the ISMS is operating effectively and meeting its defined objectives,\nthey need to be involved and conducting management reviews. The management\nreview is intended to ensure that an organization\u2019s ISMS and its objectives\ncontinue to remain appropriate and effective, given the organization\u2019s\npurpose, issues, and risks around its information assets. The management\nreview serves the critical purpose of setting the tone and expectations for\nthe organization in relation to the organization\u2019s implementation and\nmaintenance of good information security practices.\n\nManagement reviews should be pre-planned and conducted often enough to ensure\nthat the ISMS continues to operate effectively and achieve the objectives of\nthe business. The ISO 27001 standard states that reviews should take place at\nplanned intervals, generally at least once per year and within the external\naudit period. However, given the rapidly changing information security threat\nand legal and regulatory landscape, it is recommended that the ISMS governing\nbody conduct meetings more frequently, e.g. at least quarterly, to help ensure\nthat the ISMS is operating effectively; that senior management remains\ninformed; and that any adjustments to address risks or deficiencies can be\npromptly implemented.\n\n## ISO 27001 controls and domains\nAnnex A, or ISO/IEC 27002:2013, of the ISO 27001 standard is made up of a list\nof security controls that your company can utilize to improve the security of\nits information assets. ISO 27001 comprises 114 controls divided into 14\nsections, also known as domains. The sections are focused on information\ntechnology and beyond, taking into consideration the wide range of factors\nthat can impact the security of your information environment. The 14 ISO\ndomains are focused on organizational issues, human resources, IT, physical\nsecurity, and legal issues. There is no requirement to implement the full list\nof ISO 27001\u2019s controls; rather, they are possibilities for an organization to\nconsider based on its particular needs. Utilizing the 114 controls listed in\nAnnex A, your company can select those that are applicable to the needs of\nyour company and your customers. The 14 domains are:\n  * Information security policies (A.5)\n  * Organization of information security and assignment of responsibility (A.6)\n  * Human resources security (A.7)\n  * Asset management (A.8)\n  * User access control (A.9)\n  * Encryption and management of sensitive information (A.10)\n  * Physical and environmental security (A.11)\n  * Operational security (A.12)\n  * Communications security (A.13)\n  * System acquisition, development, and maintenance (A.14)\n  * Supplier relationships (A.15)\n  * Information security incident management (A.16)\n  * Information security aspects of business continuity management (A.17)\n  * Compliance (A.18)\n\n## Deep-dive: ISO 27001 required documents\nISO 27001 ISMS Required Documents and Records include:\n  * Scope of the ISMS (Clause 4.3)\n  * ISMS Information Security Policy and Objectives (Clauses 5.2 and 6.2)\n  * Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Methodology (Clause 6.1.2)\n  * Statement of Applicability (Clause 6.1.3d)\n  * Risk Assessment Results and Report (Clauses 8.2 and 8.3)\n  * Risk Treatment Plan and Results (Clauses 6.1.3e, 6.2, and 8.3)\n  * Competence Evidence (Performance Reviews, Training Records, etc.) (Clause 7.2d)\n  * Operational Planning and Control (Clause 8.1)\n  * Monitoring and Measurement Metrics (KPIs) and Results (Clause 9.1)\n  * Internal Audit Program evidence to include Internal Audit Report and Results (Clause 9.2g)\n  * Evidence of Management Reviews (Meeting Notes, Schedules, Presentations etc.) (Clause 9.3)\n  * Identified Nonconformities and Evidence of Remediation Actions Taken (Clause 10.1.f)\n  * Corrective Action Plan for Identified Nonconformities (Clause 10.1.g)\n\nAdditional Annex A Required Documents and Records include:\n  * Definition of Security Roles and Responsibilities (Clauses A.7.1.2 and A.13.2.4)\n  * Management and Inventory of Assets (Clause A.8.1.1)\n  * Acceptable Use of Assets (Clause A.8.1.3)\n  * Access Control Policy (Clause A.9.1.1)\n  * Operating Procedures for IT Management (Clause A.12.1.1)\n  * System Logs of User Activities, Exceptions, and Security Events (Clauses A.12.4.1 and A.12.4.3)\n  * Secure System Engineering and Development Principles (Clause A.14.2.5)\n  * Supplier and Vendor Security Policy (Clause A.15.1.1)\n  * Incident Response and Management Procedure (Clause A.16.1.5)\n  * Business Continuity Procedures (Clause A.17.1.2)\n  * Statutory, Regulatory, and Contractual Requirements (Clause A.18.1.1)\n\nFurther, there are a number of non-mandatory documents that can be used to\nimplement the ISO standard, particularly in addressing the security controls\nof Annex A. While these documents are not explicitly identified as mandatory,\nit is common practice for auditors to look for these documents to ensure that\nan organization\u2019s ISMS is well-defined, established, and is effectively\nmanaging risks. These documents include:\n  * Procedure for Document Control (Clause 7.5)\n  * Controls for Managing Records (Clause 7.5)\n  * Procedure for Internal Audit (Clause 9.2)\n  * Procedure for Corrective Action (Clause 10.1)\n  * Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy (Clause A.6.2.1)\n  * Mobile Device and Teleworking Policy (Clause A.6.2.1)\n  * Information and Data Classification and Handling Policy (Clauses A.8.2.1, A.8.2.2, and A.8.2.3)\n  * Password Policy (Clauses A.9.2.1, A.9.2.2, A.9.2.4, A.9.3.1, and A.9.4.3)\n  * Disposal and Destruction Policy (Clauses A.8.3.2 and A.11.2.7)\n  * Physical Security Policy and Procedures for Working in Secure Areas (Clause A.11.1.5)\n  * Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy (Clause A.11.2.9)\n  * Change Management Policy and Procedures (Clauses A.12.1.2 and A.14.2.4)\n  * Backup Policy (Clause A.12.3.1)\n  * Information Transfer Policy (Clauses A.13.2.1, A.13.2.2, and A.13.2.3)\n  * Business Impact Analysis (Clause A.17.1.1)\n  * Exercising and Testing Plan (Clause A.17.1.3)\n  * Maintenance and Review Plan (Clause A.17.1.3)\n  * Business Continuity Strategy (Clause A.17.2.1)\n\n## Common ISO 27001 pitfalls and major nonconformities\nA nonconformity is the non-fulfillment of a requirement of the ISO standard.\nIf there are requirements of the ISO standard that your company has not\naddressed; if your own documentation has specified a process that you are not\nfollowing; or if your company is not upholding contractual requirements in its\ndealings with third parties, you are treading in the space of nonconformity.\n\nYour ISO auditor will utilize nonconformities to judge the compliance of your\ncompany\u2019s ISMS against the ISO standard. An auditor will describe the\nnonconformity, provide evidence of the issue, reference by clause the\nrequirement that is not being adequately addressed, and summarize what must be\ndone to meet the stated requirement.\n\nBoth major and minor nonconformities may be recorded in the process of your\ncompany\u2019s certification audit. The presence of a major nonconformity means\nthat a company cannot get certified. Examples of major nonconformities\ninclude:\n  * Complete failure to fulfill a certain requirement of the standard\n  * Absence of mandatory documentation\n  * Breakdown of a process or procedure\n  * The accumulation of minor nonconformities in relation to one process or element of your management system, illuminating a larger problem \n  * Misuse of a certification mark, thus misleading customers \n  * Minor nonconformities left unresolved within the period allotted to their resolution\n\nA minor nonconformity is any nonconformity that is not major; designation of a\nminor nonconformity represents a failure to comply with a requirement which\nis, on its own, not likely to result in the failure of a company\u2019s ISMS.\n\n## Focus on personnel: Your first line of defense\nAs discussed earlier in this guide, information security is a responsibility\nthat extends beyond a company\u2019s IT or information security teams. Successful\ninformation security is an organization-wide process of protecting your\ncompany, and so your personnel, operating across your company, are your first\nline of defense. Employee training and awareness programs are thus a critical\npart of your company\u2019s establishment and maintenance of an effective and\nsuccessful ISMS. Personnel within all facets of your organization must be\naware of new policies and procedures, why they are necessary, how they can\nensure adherence, and what is expected of them in maintaining the ISMS.\nPersonnel should also be trained to understand the common threats that face\nyour organization that they are likely to encounter, and how they should\nappropriately respond. The absence of employee training and awareness\nactivities in a management system is a common reason for ISO 27001 project\nfailure; disciplinary or sanctions policies and processes must be in place for\npersonnel found out of compliance with the organization's requirements for\ninformation security.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.vanta.com/resources/the-ultimate-iso-27001-guide-powered-by-vanta-and-aprio", "title": "The ultimate ISO 27001 guide", "description": "In this guide, we share the recommended approach to successful implementation of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) according to the ISO 27001 standard to help prepare your organization to undergo an independent evaluation of your ISMS in order to obtain your ISO 27001 certification.", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\nWhat is ISO 27001?\nISO 27001 is the international standard that describes best practices for an Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). It\u2019s based on a set of ISO 27001 controls and measures, which organizations can use to achieve information security. \n\nThe ISO 27001 standard requires that you have procedures in place to cover aspects of the ISMS, including:\n\nInformation security risk management (What are the risks you face and how do you treat those risks?)\n\nMonitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation (How is the effectiveness of the information security management system evaluated?)\n\nImprovement (How are nonconformities evaluated and corrected?)\n\nWho Needs ISO 27001?\nAny business experiencing growth in international markets that wants to demonstrate to  customers they are preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by applying a risk management process can benefit from ISO 27001. The primary focus is empowering organizations to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their ISMS.\n\nCurious about how ISO 27001 compares to SOC 2? Learn more in this article on our blog.\n\nWhy is ISO 27001 Important?\nThe ISO 27001 standard is an effective way to keep your company\u2019s information secure when you take the right steps to implement it. It provides a structured approach to implementing, integrating, and continuously improving your ISMS. \n\nThis helps protect assets from both internal and external threats by making sure you:\n\nUnderstand the organization\u2019s needs, requirements, and risk appetite.\n\nApply policies, procedures, and controls to manage these risks within the defined parameters of the organization\u2019s tolerance levels.\n\nMonitor performance against these standards on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhat are the ISO 27001 Requirements?\nOnce you begin digging into the world of ISO 27001, it can become overwhelming, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Looking at the standard by each clause makes it much more manageable for organizations.\n\nClauses 0 to 3 are:\n\nIntroduction\n\nScope\n\nNormative references\n\nTerms and definitions\n\nThese clauses cover the basics of ISO 27001 and provide the context you need to begin to understand the core concepts. Clauses 4 to 10 provide ISO 27001 requirements organizations need to meet to conform with the standard.\n\nA Closer Look at Clauses 4 to 10\nUnderstanding each of these clauses is critical to success with ISO 27001. Here\u2019s a brief summary of what you need to know about each one.\n\nClause 4: Context of the Organization\nIt\u2019s important to understand the organization\u2019s context\u2014its environment and its relationships. These elements will include understanding the needs of both internal and external interested parties relevant to the ISMS and determining the boundaries and applicability of ISMS to establish its scope. \n\nClause 5: Leadership\nYou\u2019ll need solid leadership to succeed. Leadership is required to establish the information security policy and information security objectives,, decide on strategic objectives and ensure that adequate resources needed for the ISMS are available. They also need to assign responsibilities and promote continual improvement.\n\nClause 6: Planning \nYou must factor in all risks and opportunities before taking further steps. Do a risk assessment and assess the realistic likelihood and occurrence of the risk identified and determine the level of risk. Based on the risk assessment results, select appropriate risk treatment options and determine all controls necessary to implement the information security risk treatment options selected. \n\nYou must create a Statement of Applicability (SoA) that contains the necessary controls and justifications for inclusion, whether they are implemented and justification for exclusions of controls from Annex A.\n\nClause 7: Support \nFor your team to conform to the  ISO 27001 standard, they need information to support their actions. This means establishing resources, training, and communication policies that keep everyone in the loop, as well as documenting key details.\n\nClause 8: Operation\nProcesses are what keeps everyone on the same page with effective information security risk management. Design processes that promote a security-first mindset and be sure to take control of the implementation of these processes. Unintended changes will need to be evaluated to mitigate adverse effects, as necessary. \n\nClause 9: Performance Evaluation\nYou must evaluate the information security performance and effectiveness of the ISMS and determine the procedures for monitoring the ISMS. If your organization is pursuing or maintaining ISO 27001 certification, you\u2019ll also need to perform internal  audits at planned intervals, and top management will also need to review your ISMS at planned intervals to ensure its continuing effectiveness.\n\nClause 10: Improvement\nThere\u2019s almost always room for improvement. After your evaluation, follow up by taking action and addressing any issues you uncover. Additionally, you can continue to look for opportunities to improve as your organization evolves.\n\nConsidering Annex A: Reference Control Objectives and Controls\nAnnex A provides organizations with a list of controls that need to be evaluated to determine if they are necessary for mitigating risk. They aren\u2019t mandatory. However, you are required to determine if all necessary Annex A controls have been considered and necessary ones haven\u2019t been omitted.\n\nGetting Started\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to start for ISO 27001 certification, here\u2019s a basic outline to help guide you through. \n\nDefine Your ISMS Scope \nOne of the most important steps in becoming ISO 27001 certified is defining the scope of your ISMS.. Your scope should cover your organization\u2019s systems, processes, locations, services, applications, departments, people, and data, etc. that make up the components of your ISMS.\n\nPerform a Risk Assessment\nTo ensure your ISMS addresses threats appropriately and conforms with ISO 27001, you\u2019ll need to perform a risk assessment. A risk assessment will help you identify the necessary controls to mitigate applicable risk. For risks that require mitigation strategies, you will need to create risk treatment plans.\n\nComplete Your Statement of Applicability\nAs mentioned above, your SoA should state which Annex A controls were determined to be necessary for inclusion  to treat the risks outlined in your risk assessment and justification for which Annex A controls were excluded. \n\nDocument Your Information Security Policies\nThe policies you implement will become the foundation of your information security strategy and should be defined, approved, published, and communicated with the broader organization. Your policy should be relevant to your organization, clarify your information security objectives, show a commitment to satisfy ISO 27001 requirements and the included Annex A controls, and ensure continuous improvement of the ISMS.\n\nOperationalize Your ISMS \nOperationalize your ISMS by implementing processes to meet Clauses 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. These clauses cover planning, risk assessment, document control, procedure implementation, monitoring, and how your strategy and policies will remain current with updates and improvements. \n\nEnsure your strategy and policies are synced with tactical activities that prove your ISMS is operational and repeatable\u2014meaning you\u2019re able to assess risks, execute control processes, track metrics, and identify and implement corrective actions. \n\nPerform an Internal Audit\nAn internal audit is required to be completed as a means of independently monitoring your ISMS. The internal audit will help you find any nonconformities, determine the effectiveness of your ISMS, and discover any potential opportunities for improvement.\n\nImplement Corrective Actions From Internal Audit\nFrom the findings in your internal audit, implement corrective actions for any nonconformities. Your plan should include: \n\nThe nonconformity identified. \n\nHow you intend to correct, control, and deal with the consequences of the nonconformity.\n\nThe root cause of the nonconformity.\n\nThe effectiveness of your correction. \n\nReview Your ISMS\nIt\u2019s required for senior-level management to continuously review the ISMS to ensure its effectiveness and that it meets your organization\u2019s objectives. \n\nSchedule recurring review meetings that go over: \n\nInternal or external changes that impact the ISMS. \n\nStatus updates on past ISMS reviews.\n\nFeedback from internal audits, risk assessments, and interested parties.\n\nAny updates or improvements. \n\nBe sure to document the results and actions from your reviews.  \n\nEngage an Accredited Certification Body\nOnce you\u2019re ready to go for ISO 27001 certification, you\u2019ll need to choose an accredited certification body to perform the audit\u2014Stage 1 and Stage 2 audits. A Stage 1 audit primarily reviews your documentation and determines your readiness for Stage 2. Stage 2 is a full review of your ISMS to ensure conformance with the requirements, that applicable controls are implemented and effective, and that you meet your internal policies and procedures. \n\nImplement Corrective Actions From Identified Nonconformities\nFindings in your audit may create an opportunity to improve your information security strategy. If your auditor identified any nonconformities, be sure to implement corrective actions and track their effectiveness.  \n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.drata.com/blog/iso-27001-compliance", "title": "ISO 27001: A Beginner\u2019s Guide", "description": "Starting your journey to ISO 27001 compliance?

{"page_content": "\nAs your organization grows and adds new technologies, your IT risks evolve. Malicious actors increasingly use supply chain attacks to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. In response, legislative bodies and regulatory agencies implement more rigorous compliance requirements. Meanwhile, customers often require companies to prove that they understand their risk and have mitigating controls in place. \n\nMany compliance mandates integrate the controls and processes defined within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000-series. In particular, ISO 27001 describes best practices for building an information security management system (ISMS). \n\nAs you start your ISO certification journey, you need to understand how to conduct an ISO 27001 Risk Assessment because it\u2019s the foundation for everything else. \n\nWhat is an ISO 27001 Risk Assessment?\nClause 6.1.2 of ISO 27001 outlines the requirements for an information security risk assessment, requiring that organizations:\n\nEstablish and maintain information security risk criteria.\n\nImplement repeatable processes that produce consistent, valid, and comparable results.\n\nIdentify information security risks.\n\nAnalyze information security risks.\n\nEvaluate information security risks.\n\nThe ISO 27001 risk assessment guides every other activity that the organization takes to protect sensitive data. \n\nWhat Does ISO 27001 Require?\nEmbedded within ISO 27001\u2019s general risk assessment requirements, the standard also includes several actions to take and documents to collect. It\u2019s important to remember that a risk assessment requirement, like ISO\u2019s, is intended to provide a flexible framework rather than a prescriptive set of steps. \n\nWhen you dig into the risk assessment clause a little further, you start to get a better sense of what ISO expects from you. Some key requirements include:\n\nDefining the risk acceptance criteria in the policy.\n\nDefining the assessment criteria in the policy.\n\nIdentifying information confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks. \n\nIdentifying risk owners.\n\nAssessing the potential consequences if the identified risks materialize.\n\nRealistically assessing the likelihood that the risks will occur.\n\nDetermining risk level.\n\nComparing risk analysis with risk criteria.\n\nPrioritizing risk treatment.\n\nAs part of the planning process, your risk assessment provides the map that helps you outline everything from how you design your architecture to how you measure your security program\u2019s effectiveness. \n\nKey Reports \nSince everything about compliance and audit relies on documentation, your risk assessment will generate reports used during the audit. \n\nRisk Assessment Table\nThe risk assessment table lists the organization\u2019s:\n\nAssets and information resources.\n\nIdentified vulnerabilities and threats.\n\nRisk level. \n\nRisk Assessment and Risk Treatment Methodology\nThis report outlines how you measure risk and incorporates your company\u2019s context. For example, you should consider including:\n\nLegal, regulatory, and compliance requirements.\n\nBusiness objectives. \n\nInformation security objectives.\n\nStakeholder expectations.\n\nOnce you define how you plan to assess risk, you can create consistent processes for how to treat risks. This means knowing what risks you plan to:\n\nAccept\n\nAvoid\n\nTransfer\n\nMitigate\n\nNot every risk is equally important, and you might decide to accept something with a low risk of adversely affecting your company because mitigating it is cost-prohibitive. On the other hand, you might choose to mitigate a risk that could negatively impact your company because it provides an equally important benefit and cost-effective mitigations exist. \n\nStatement of Applicability (SoA)\nThe SoA documents which ISO 27001 Annex A controls you implemented, how you implemented them, and your reasoning for implementing them. In addition, if you chose not to implement controls, you must also document why you felt they weren\u2019t necessary within your unique environment. \n\nFor each control, you want to explain which of the following requirements it fulfills:\n\nLegal obligations\n\nContractual obligations\n\nBusiness requirements \n\nResults of risk assessment\n\nRisk Treatment Plan\nWhile your risk treatment methodology explains how you make risk tolerance decisions, your risk treatment plan outlines the actions that you plan to take for each identified risk. Basically, the document proves you appropriately applied the methodology in practice. \n\nIn many ways, the risk treatment plan is similar to the risk treatment methodology. You\u2019re documenting a list of assets, threats, and risk-based choices. In addition to those, your risk treatment plan will include:\n\nA person responsible for the asset.\n\nThe security control(s) that mitigate risk.\n\nThe person responsible for implementing and maintaining the control(s).\n\nDeadlines associated with implementing, monitoring, and reviewing control(s).\n\nResources needed to implement the control(s), including staffing and budgets.\n\nMethod of evaluating control implementation.\n\n10 Steps to Conduct an Effective Asset-Based Risk Assessment  \nRisk assessments involve a lot of people and a lot of moving parts. In the same way that you want repeatable outcomes, you need to put repeatable processes in place. \n\n1. Create a Cross-Functional Team\nNo one person in your company knows everything about your technology stack or the risks you need to consider. When you build out a team, you want to include stakeholders from across the organization, including:\n\nIT\n\nSenior leadership\n\nDepartment managers\n\nLegal\n\nCompliance/Audit\n\n2. Establish an Asset Inventory\nYou can\u2019t protect what you don\u2019t know you have. Your asset inventory should include:\n\nData\n\nDevices, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network devices, and mobile devices\n\nUsers\n\nStorage locations\n\nNetworks\n\nApplications/Software\n\nYou need to create an asset inventory that\u2019s as complete as possible, so you should be monitoring for new assets regularly\u2014especially in cloud environments. \n\n3. Assign Each Asset a Risk Level\nFor each asset, you want to consider whether it poses a high, medium, or low risk to the organization. This is where you look at your organization\u2019s context, like legal or compliance risks. For example, privacy laws regulate how you need to handle personally identifiable information (PII), so that data poses a high compliance risk. \n\n4. Define Threats and Vulnerabilities\nOnce you know all your assets, you can outline threats and vulnerabilities for each one. \n\nFor technologies, you want to consider things like:\n\nCommon vulnerabilities and exposures.\n\nAvailability of security updates.\n\nPotential downtime.\n\nKnown attacks targeting them.\n\nYou also want to consider administrative and procedural threats and vulnerabilities like:\n\nAn employee leaving the organization.\n\nLack of process documentation.\n\nEmployee security awareness.\n\n5. Analyze Risk\nWhen you analyze risk, you consider the likelihood that an event will happen and compare it to the damage it causes. A high-risk asset with a low likelihood of experiencing a risky event might be a moderate risk overall. \n\n6. Document Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment Methodology\nOnce you have analyzed all your assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and risks, you can write your risk assessment and treatment methodology. This aggregates all the activities you\u2019ve engaged in and allows you to outline your reasons for accepting, refusing, mitigating, or transferring the risks. \n\n7. Choose and Document ISO 27001 Controls\nOnce you\u2019ve determined which risks you want to mitigate, you start working through the different ISO 27001 Annex A controls listed in ISO 27002. For each asset, you define the threat/vulnerability and document which control(s) apply, including your reasoning for implementing them. \n\n8. Implement and Test Chosen Controls\nWhen it comes to compliance, your actions speak louder than your words. For each control, you need to use either a technology or a process for implementing it. You should be documenting how you implemented the control, who\u2019s responsible for the implementation, and when you completed the implementation. \n\n9. Monitor Controls\nSecurity changes continuously, so you need to make sure that you monitor whether your controls are working as intended. For example, security researchers continue to find new vulnerabilities in operating systems and software. T\n\no ensure continued control effectiveness, you should run vulnerability scanners and update software or operating systems with security patches. To monitor whether your vulnerability and patch management controls are working, you need a way to make sure that all devices connected to the network are securely configured. \n\n10. Report Program Effectiveness to Leadership \nISO 27001 certification requires oversight from senior management and the board of directors. With everything documented and monitored, you need to give everyone the information that allows them to make informed decisions when risks change. \n\nYour reports should include key performance indicators that show whether controls work as intended to mitigate risk or whether you need to update the risk treatment plan with additional controls. \n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.drata.com/blog/iso-27001-risk-assessment", "title": "ISO 27001 Risk Assessment: 10 Step Guide to an Effective Assessment", "description": "Conducting an effective ISO 27001 risk assessment is fundamental to achieving compliance.

{"page_content": "\nWhat\u2019s an ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability?\nA Statement of Applicability is a document required for ISO 27001 certification. It\u2019s a document  that states the Annex A controls that your organization determined to be necessary for mitigating information security risk and the Annex A controls that were excluded. \n\nThis is an internal document that you typically only share with your organization and your certification body. That said, it\u2019s essential to get it right\u2014failing to do so could slow down the process of certification.\n\nHow to Create Your Statement of Applicability\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the steps you\u2019ll need to take to put together an SoA for your organization.\n\nUnderstand the Requirements\nThe first step to writing an ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability is understanding the requirements which can be overwhelming if you\u2019re new to information security or ISO 27001. \n\nNevertheless, understanding these requirements will help ensure that your SoA is accurate and complete. For a high-level breakdown of ISO 27001 requirements, check out this guide. \n\nConduct a Risk Assessment\nTo begin the process of writing an ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability, you will need to conduct a risk assessment. The purpose of this step is to evaluate the information security risks that could pose harm or loss to your organization.\n\nIf you have already completed a risk assessment, use that information as a starting point. \n\nIf not, start by:\n\nDetermining the Appropriate Methodology \nYour risk assessment should be tailored to your organization\u2019s environment and circumstances. In other words, you should choose a risk assessment methodology that gathers the information you need about the particular risks affecting your company.  \n\nMost risk assessments can follow a qualitative approach which uses judgment to categorize risks on a low to high scale of probability, or quantitative, which uses mathematical formulas to calculate expected monetary losses of certain risks. These methodologies can also be combined with other methods like asset-based or threat-based. \n\nBoth ISO 27005 and NIST SP 800-30 standards can provide guidance for determining the most appropriate risk methodology.\n\nLooking for Guidance\nIf you don\u2019t have a cybersecurity expert on your team, you could hire a consultant to help identify threats that could affect your organization\u2019s ability or success in achieving its goals. They may suggest strategies or tools they\u2019ve used when working with companies in your industry which can help form your own plan.\n\nAgain, this can be particularly useful if you\u2019re a new organization or don\u2019t have much experience with risk assessments. Getting input from others can help create a more complete risk profile.\n\nDetermine Your Risk Management Strategy\nThis is the point where you define your risk management strategy, identify security risks, and what you need to implement to manage those risks effectively. For example, an organization may decide to implement an encryption solution for securing sensitive data. \n\nOnce you define all parts of your risk management strategy, you will have a clearer picture of what type(s) of controls will be best suited for addressing each component within your organization\u2019s IT system.\n\nSelect the Security Controls Most Relevant to Your Organization\nEvery company is different, and that means the controls you implement may be unique to your organization or industry.\n\nIf you run a large manufacturing business with multiple warehouses where inventory is always being shipped out or returned to storage, then physical access control could be part of your ISO 27001 certification process.\n\nHowever, other companies may find that they don\u2019t face many physical security risks and that another set of controls are at the top of their priority list. \n\nComplete the SoA \nAt this point, you have everything you need to put your Statement of Applicability together. \n\nIf you have chosen to exclude an Annex A control, it\u2019s important to provide justification for this decision. You should include the risks that were considered and determined not to be a high priority. If possible, explain why a particular risk was deemed unfit for inclusion. \n\nYou will also need to document the reason for including Annex A controls. Typically, the reason for including Annex A controls is because the control was determined to be necessary for mitigating a specific information security risk.\n\nPlan Annual Updates\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your Statement of Applicability and risk assessment, you\u2019ll need to keep a close eye on it. You should regularly review the document to ensure that you\u2019re still meeting the requirements described in the standard.\n\nAdditionally, be sure to stay up to date with any technology changes that may impact your program and risk treatment plan.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.drata.com/blog/iso-27001-statement-of-applicability", "title": "ISO 27001: How to Write a Statement of Applicability", "description": "You need a Statement of Applicability for an ISO 27001 certification.

{"page_content": "\nHow Do You Begin Your Journey for ISO 27001?\nInitiating the project usually involves a few steps. Before conducting a readiness assessment or an internal audit, getting management buy-in for the project will be at the top of your list. Steve recommends clearly defining the benefits of ISO 27001, including ways strong cyber and information security can strengthen the brand, increase client trust, and save the organization millions of dollars by preventing data breaches.\n\nOnce management signs off, it\u2019s always best to perform a readiness assessment or an internal audit to see which areas of your organization need improvement.\n\nWhat is the Biggest Mistake Companies Make When Preparing for ISO 27001?\nNot conducting a readiness assessment or internal audit beforehand can bring up a lot of problems down the road. Steve points out that it\u2019s common for businesses to move forward with a project without actually assessing their implementation or usage of the controls they\u2019ve put in place. \n\nCertification bodies want to see companies that fully understand and apply the measures they\u2019ve set, so it\u2019s important to keep your employees educated and accountable. It\u2019s also wise to conduct a gap assessment once you\u2019ve started to put controls in place to catch any of these issues.\n\nSteve also warns against these things when preparing for ISO 27001:\n\nImproperly defining the ISMS scope\n\nInadequate employee security training\n\nImproperly performed risk assessments\n\nMetrics and implementation plans for info sec don\u2019t align with company objectives\n\nImproper record keeping\u2014ISO is really big on having evidence\n\nInadequate access controls and access management\u2014especially in DevOps \n\nHow Do I Know My Organization is Ready for an ISO 27001 Audit?\nIf you\u2019re in a mature organization with several infosec controls, it could merely be putting those policies into place. For those starting from scratch, it could be a heavier lift. \n\nOnce you have everything in place (internal audit, pre-certification readiness assessment), Steve recommends conducting a management review to make sure upper management is aware of the entire ISMS. These reviews go over every single part of the ISMS\u2014including policies, metrics, operations, and any deficiencies in the internal audit.\n\nBefore undergoing an audit, Steve suggests you have:\n\nAll the basic documentation in place, including running the system for a period of three to six months.\n\nA trained team that promotes a cyber aware culture.\n\nRisk assessment and risk treatment plans in place.\n\nA connection with your certification body\u2014they can offer specific advice as to what you need to do to get ready and what you should be on the lookout for.\n\nAt least 75% passing tests and controls in your compliance automation system.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know if you\u2019re ready.

{"page_content": "\nWhat is ISO 27001:2022?\nISO 27001:2022 is the framework specifying the requirements an organization should use when establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS). \n\nIntended to be applicable to companies of all sizes and across all industry verticals, the generic requirements include the information security risk assessment and treatment.\n\nWhat is ISO 27002:2022?\nISO 27002:2022 provides a set of generic information security controls that organizations use when establishing and maintaining an ISMS. Since the information security controls are based on internationally recognized best practices, organizations can implement them as listed or use them to develop organization-specific information security management controls. \n\nSimilarly, organizations can choose to use a completely different control set when implementing ISO 27001:2022 rather than using or customizing the controls listed in ISO 27002:2022.\n\n5 Critical Differences Between ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 27002:2022\nAlthough the two documents work together, they have several significant differences.\n\nPurpose\nISO 27001 outlines the foundational qualities that start by:\n\nUnderstanding your organization and its context.\n\nUnderstanding the needs and expectations of different internal and external stakeholders.\n\nDetermining the ISMS\u2019s scope.\n\nISO 27002 supplements by outlining and detailing the controls that you will implement to support the way your ISMS addresses your information security risk. Additionally, it provides guidance around how to implement these controls. \n\nContents\nAs the purpose of each document drives the content, the information each one contains differs. \n\nISO 27001 defines seven clauses, which are broken into subclauses. The first three sections of the ISO 27001 are administrative information such as scope, definitions, and similar items and are not actionable by an organization implementing ISO 27001. \n\nThe remaining clauses and their subclauses focus on how to establish, implement, and maintain an internal program based on processes, including:\n\nLeadership\n\nPlanning\n\nSupport\n\nOperation\n\nPerformance evaluation\n\nImprovement\n\nMeanwhile, ISO 27002 contains the controls that support the processes outlined in ISO 27001. The document details the 93 controls that it separates according to four themes:\n\nOrganizational\n\nPeople\n\nPhysical\n\nTechnological\n\nLevel of Detail About Controls\nAlthough both documents discuss the information security controls, ISO 27001 only provides a very high-level list in its Appendix A. \n\nISO 27002 goes into far more detail, providing the following for each control:\n\nShort name for the control\n\nA table outlining the control\u2019s attributes\n\nWhat the control is\n\nWhy you should implement the control\n\nHow you should implement the control\n\nAdditional explanations or references to other related documents\n\nApplicability\nWhen establishing an ISMS, every organization needs to incorporate ISO 27001\u2019s requirements. The document specifically explains under Scope:\n\nExcluding any of the requirements specified in Clauses 4 to 10 is not acceptable when an organization claims conformity to this document. \n\nHowever, the fundamental basis of your ISO 27001 implementation is your organization\u2019s risk assessment and treatment. \n\nBased on how your organization defines risk and chooses to treat risk, you may not need to implement every single ISO 27002 control. ISO 27002:2022\u2019s Annex A exists to show organizations how they can use attributes so that they can create different views of controls. In section Annex A, section A.2, ISO notes:\n\nOrganizations can discard the examples of attributes proposed in this document and create their own attributes with different values to address specific needs in the organization. In addition, the values assigned to each attribute can differ between organizations. \n\nWhile organizations need to have all the components of an ISMS listed in ISO 27001, they can implement controls based on ISO 27002:2022 in a way that makes sense for their unique business and security needs. \n\nCertification\nISO certifications only apply to an organization\u2019s ability to conform to ISO 27001. \n\nTo achieve an ISO 27001 certification, you need to:\n\nCreate a project plan that defines responsibilities, oversight, and milestone management.\n\nDefine the ISMS\u2019s scope by determining whether it will encompass the entire organization or focus on a single department/system.\n\nPerform a risk assessment that focuses on identifying risks applicable to the scope you defined in step two and how to mitigate those risks.\n\nEngage in a gap assessment that identifies current controls and determines additional controls needed to fully mitigate risk.\n\nDesign, implement, and document policies, and controls. \n\nDocument and collect evidence proving that policies and controls function as intended.\n\nISO 27002 doesn\u2019t have a certification because it\u2019s just a list of optional controls. However, most organizations will use ISO 27002 for steps four through six of the certification process. \n\nHow Do ISO 27002:2022 Controls Support ISO 27001 Compliance?\nUnderstanding how the documents work together is easier when you have a concrete example. \n\nISO 27001 ISMS Requirement\nWithin Clause 6 Planning, Subsection 6.2 states:\n\nWhen planning how to achieve its security objectives, the organization shall determine:\n\nWhat will be done. \n\nWhat resources will be required.\n\nWho will be responsible.\n\nWhen it will be completed.\n\nHow the results will be evaluated.\n\nThis section is about planning the control implementations that mitigate risk as determined within the risk assessment. To determine the controls, you look at ISO 27001\u2019s Annex A. \n\nWithin Annex A, you\u2019ll find the following control,\n\n5.9 Inventory of information and other associated assets: An inventory of information and other associated assets, including owners, shall be developed and maintained.\n\nISO 27002:2022\nAll the details about control 5.9 are outlined in ISO 27002. \n\n27002 defines the purpose as:\n\nTo identify the organization\u2019s information and other associated assets in order to preserve their information security and assign appropriate ownership. \n\nThe Guidance section provides additional information including:\n\nIdentifying assets\n\nCategorizing them by importance based on the type of data associated with them\n\nKeeping the inventory accurate and updated\n\nConducting regular reviews \n\nAutomatically enforcing updates when installing, changing, or removing an asset\n\nDetailing the asset owner duties\n\nControl Implementation\nAn example of the control implementation would be an asset inventory that contains a list of all assets listed as high, medium, and low risk based on the data they process, manage, or store. It would also list the person responsible for managing and updating it, the date of the most recent entry, and the operating system/software/firmware version.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.drata.com/blog/iso-27001-vs-iso-27002", "title": "5 Critical Differences Between ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 27002:2022", "description": "Wondering what the difference is between ISO 27001 and ISO 27002?

{"page_content": "\nAt first glance, the recently published ISO 27001:2022 looks like an entirely new standard which can feel overwhelming. Even just glancing through the table of contents, you\u2019ll see a change in formatting when compared to ISO 27001:2013. \n\nWhile the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) did shift its focus and requires you to think differently about your ISO 27001 program, the fundamental difference is the standard\u2019s organization.

The first place you see this change is in Note 2 under Subsection 6.1.3:\n\nAnnex A contains a list of possible information security controls. Users of this document are directed to Annex A to ensure that no necessary information security controls are overlooked. \n\nIn the 2013 publication, Note 1 reads:\n\nAnnex A contains a comprehensive list of control objectives and controls. Users of this International Standard are directed to Annex A to ensure that no necessary controls are overlooked. \n\nThese two major mindset changes for ISO 27001:2022 are:\n\nRecognizing that information security is dynamic. \n\nMoving away from the \u201ccontrol objectives\u201d language.\n\nISO considers 27001:2022 to create minimum baseline controls rather than a closed, comprehensive list. \n\nAdditionally, by removing the phrase \u201ccontrol objectives\u201d from the entire document, ISO is moving away from the future focused \u201cwe hope that this control works as intended.\u201d The controls are now focused on \u201cthis is what we actually have in place, and this is why we did this.\u201d\n\nA High-Level View of the Table of Contents\nIf you\u2019re just opening up the new publication, the table of contents might seem like it\u2019s adding several new sections under:\n\nPlanning\n\nSupport\n\nPerformance Evaluation\n\nOnce you start digging into the standard and comparing the two side-by-side, the reality is that these changes just serve to highlight pre-existing content, making them more obvious and indicating that ISO believes they should be considered on their own. \n\nWhat Do These Changes Mean for Your Compliance?\nFor the most part, ISO 27001:2022 changes very little. Only a few new controls have been added. However, it\u2019s important to highlight one fundamental change surrounding compliance documentation. \n\nEverywhere that ISO 27001:2022 mentions documentation, the language now requires that: documented information shall be available.\n\nThe original 2013 language focus required that organizations: shall keep documented information.\n\nThe use of the word \u201cavailability\u201d implies that companies should have the ability to provide the information when someone asks for it rather than just keeping it stored.\n\nThe Reorganization of ISO 27001:2022 Annex A\nISO 27001:2022\u2019s changes don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. ISO released 27001:2022, 27002:2022, and 27005:2022 all at the same time because they\u2019re highly interconnected. The reorganization of 27001:2022\u2019s Annex A corresponds directly to the reorganization of 27002:2022.\n\nInstead of 14 categories of controls, 27002:2022 and 27001:2022 are now grouped into four categories, which ISO refers to as \u201cthemes\u201d:\n\nOrganizational Controls\n\nPeople Controls\n\nPhysical Controls\n\nTechnological Controls\n\nOrganizational Controls\nThe organizational controls are defined first within the ISO 27002:2022. This section defines the higher level, governance-focused controls of the ISO 27001 framework. These set the stage for the more actionable controls defined within the other three themes.\n\nWhen you sift through and compare the two documents, you\u2019ll notice that Organizational Controls aggregates the following under one heading:\n\nManagement direction for information security\n\nAsset management\n\nInformation classification\n\nSupplier relationships\n\nAccess control\n\nIncident management\n\nBusiness continuity management\n\nCompliance with legal and contractual requirements\n\nInformation security reviews\n\nSo what\u2019s new in ISO 27001:2022?\n\nAlthough ISO rewrote many controls so that they would better align with its new mindset, it did add a few new controls:\n\n5.7 Threat intelligence\n\n5.23 Information security for use of cloud services\n\n5.30 ICT readiness for business continuity\n\nPhysical Controls\nISO categorizes controls as physical if they concern physical objects. \n\nThe Physical Controls section aggregates:\n\nPhysical and environmental security\n\nEquipment\n\nOnly one new physical control was added, \u201c7.4 Physical security monitoring.\u201d All the other controls are exactly the same as in the 2013 publication.\n\nTechnological Controls\nAccording to ISO, Technological Controls are the ones that concern technology. \n\nThe Technological Controls section aggregates:\n\nSystem and application access control\n\nOperational procedures\n\nRedundancies\n\nProtection from malware\n\nTest data\n\nTechnical vulnerability management\n\nSecurity in development and support processes\n\nBackup\n\nSystem and application access control\n\nCryptography\n\nTechnical vulnerability management\n\nThe changes to previous controls and all new controls really respond to the risks arising from digital transformation, cloud-based environments, and new privacy laws.\n\nThe new Technological Controls are:\n\n8.9 Configuration management\n\n8.10 Information deletion\n\n8.11 Data masking\n\n8.12 Data leakage prevention\n\n8.16 Monitoring activities\n\n8.23 Web filtering\n\n8.28 Secure coding\n\nA few rewrites should also be highlighted. For example:\n\n8.16 Monitoring activities: \u201canomalous behavior\u201d responds to cloud risks\n\n8.19 Installation of software on operational systems: old \u201crestrictions on software installation\u201d more aligned to remote work and mobile devices\n\n8.30 Outsourced development: \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201creview\u201d responds to third-party risks\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.drata.com/blog/iso-27001-2022-update", "title": "What\u2019s New in ISO 27001:2022?

{"page_content": "\nMain ISO 27001 Certification Cost Factors to Consider\nThere are several different components that influence the cost of ISO 27001 certification, but there\u2019s one high-level consideration we recommend looking at first:\n\nCompany Size and Complexity\nThe cost of ISO 27001 certification depends on the state of your organization and how much work you need to do to achieve certification. This is largely because the actual time it takes to perform an audit varies depending on the complexity of the information security management system.\n\nThe initial certification cost, which includes a Stage 1 and Stage 2 audit performed by an ISO 27001 certification body (i.e external auditor), for a small company with less than 50 employees is likely to come in at less than $15,000. In contrast, companies with hundreds or thousands of employees can expect costs to be at least $20,000 for the initial certification.\n\nPreparation\nOne of the expenses to plan for is going to be a certification audit from an accredited certification body. An external auditor performs tests on your systems and procedures to ensure that they\u2019re up to par with ISO standards.\n\nThe audit process also takes time, so it\u2019s important to think about how that may impact your organization and when you can expect to get the certification. The number of controls you need to implement can also affect the time it takes for you to achieve certification. \n\nInternal Audits\nBefore you achieve certification, you\u2019ll need to go through an internal audit. Internal audits are required by the ISO 27001 standard as a means of monitoring the effectiveness of your information security management system (ISMS). As a result of the internal audit, you will be required to implement corrective actions for any nonconformities identified.\n\nThe individual performing the internal audit must be independent of the personnel operating the ISMS. An employee of your organization can perform the internal audit, but if they are not considered independent, then you will have to hire an outside party to perform the internal audit on your behalf. \n\nThe cost of an ISO 27001 internal for a small to medium size company will cost $5,000 to $15,000. An internal audit is required each year in order to obtain and maintain certification.  \n\nImplementation\nImplementation will consist of training, documentation, and overseeing changes, which can add up to your overall cost to certification quickly. Let\u2019s take a close look at how each one of these may impact your budget.\n\nDocumentation\nThere are specific pieces of documentation you need to get ISO 27001 certification, which will require additional time and resources.\n\nSome of the requirements include:\n\n4.3 The scope of the ISMS\n\n5.2 Information security policy\n\n6.1.2 Information security risk assessment process\n\n6.1.3 Information security risk treatment plan\n\n6.1.3 The Statement of Applicability\n\n6.2 Information security objectives\n\n7.5.3 Control of documented information\n\n8.1 Operational planning and control\n\n8.2 Results of the information security risk assessment\n\n8.3 Results of the information security risk treatment\n\n9.1 Evidence of the monitoring and measurement of results\n\n9.2 An internal audit process\n\n9.2 Evidence of the audit programs and the audit results\n\n9.3 Evidence of the results of management reviews\n\n10.1 Evidence of any non-conformities and corrective actions taken\n\nThink through the time it will take for your company to collect and organize all this information. Every organization will be in a different place when it comes to managing and collecting these details.\n\nTraining\nAs you take on this initiative, you\u2019ll need to provide security awareness training to the people in your organization. In addition to the upfront cost of the training program, you\u2019ll also need to factor in the time spent by your employees to complete their training and any downturn in productivity.\n\nEstablishing New Processes\nNew processes and controls will need to be implemented, some of which may be corrective actions that are critical to meet compliance. They will likely come with a bit of a learning curve for everyone on your team, which again, could have an impact on productivity.\n\nSecurity Tools and Tests\nNew security tools such as access control systems, DDoS protection, and encryption software, as well as, penetration tests, and vulnerability scanning also factor into ISO 27001 costs.\n\nFor example, penetration testing, which gives you a detailed report of potential vulnerabilities and how much damage they could do, allowing you to prioritize fixes based on risk level can start at as low as $4,000, but increase significantly with complexity.\n\nVulnerability scanning, which gives you a view of potential holes in your security without going into detail about what those holes might be or how much damage they could cause typically costs about $2,500.\n\nMaintenance and Surveillance \nThe ongoing investment costs associated with ISO 27001 certification are minimal, but they do exist. Developing and updating your risk assessment and risk treatment plan, as well as annual reviews of these documents, will require resources. \n\nYou\u2019ll also need to develop an internal audit plan and a process to maintain your security policy. Additionally\u2014and most importantly\u2014certification itself requires renewal every three years, which comes at an additional cost.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll need to plan for the fees that come with surveillance audits, which take place each year between your ISO 27001 certification audits. Surveillance audits will cost your organization between $5,000-$10,000 each.\n\nISO 27001 certification has the potential to be a great investment for your company. It can help ensure your security program\u2019s effectiveness, build trust with new customers, and achieve better business outcomes.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.drata.com/blog/iso-27001-certification-cost", "title": "Budgeting for ISO 27001: How Much Does Certification Cost?", "description": "Considering ISO 27001?

{"page_content": "\n\n# How to Transition to ISO 27001:2022\n\n## ISO 27001:2022: The new standard for information security\n\nISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management\nsystems (ISMS). It provides organisations with a framework for managing their\ninformation security risks and protecting sensitive data.\n\nThe latest version of ISO 27001, published in 2022, includes several\nsignificant changes. These changes are designed to make the standard more\nrelevant to the current threat landscape and to help organisations improve\ntheir information security posture.\n\n\n## Why is it important to transition to ISO 27001:2022?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why it is important for organisations to\ntransition to ISO 27001:2022. These include:\n\n  * To comply with the latest international standards for information security.  \n  \n\n  * To protect sensitive data from cyber threats.  \n  \n\n  * To demonstrate to customers, partners, and other stakeholders that the organisation is committed to information security.  \n  \n\n  * To improve the organisation's overall risk management processes.  \n  \n\n  * To reduce the risk of data breaches and other incidents.  \n  \n\n  * To improve the organisation's efficiency and effectiveness.  \n  \n\n  * To further improve the maturity of CIA ( **Confidentiality, Integrity** and **Availability** of data).\n\n\n## ISO 27001:2022 transition timeline\n\nThe transition period for ISO 27001:2022 began on October 31, 2022, and will\nend on October 31, 2025.\n\nDuring this time, organisations that are already certified to ISO 27001:2013\nhave three years to transition to the new standard.\n\nOrganisations that have not yet started their ISO 27001 certification journey\nhave until April 1, 2024, to become certified to the new standard.\n\nHere is a detailed timeline of the transition period:\n\n  * October 31, 2022: The transition period begins.  \n  \n\n  * May 1, 2024: All initial (new) certifications should be to the ISO 27001:2022 edition.  \n  \n\n  * July 31, 2025: All transition audits should be conducted by this date.  \n  \n\n  * October 31, 2025: The transition period ends. Certificates for ISO/IEC 27001:2013 will no longer be valid after this date.\n\nOrganisations that are already certified to ISO 27001:2013:\n\n  * Can continue to operate under their existing certification until October 31, 2025.  \n  \n\n  * Must transition to ISO 27001:2022 by this date (October 2025).  \n  \n\n  * Can choose to transition at any time during the transition period.  \n  \n\n  * May need to undergo a transition audit to verify their compliance with the new standard.\n\nOrganisations that are already certified will have until the 31st of October\n2025 as the deadline to transition. As of that date, all certifications for\nISO 27001:2013 will expire and will no longer be considered valid.\n\nIn the meantime, organisations should continue to manage and improve their\nexisting 27001:2013 ISMS in conjunction with planning a transition audit. If\nyour company is not certified yet but still wants to certify against the 2013\nrevision, you can do so up to the 31st of October, 2024.\n\nBut generally speaking, the sooner you comply with ISO 27001:2022 \u2014 the\nbetter. It will save you time, money and frustration.\n\n\nOrganisations that have not yet started their ISO 27001 certification journey:\n\n  * Must become certified to ISO 27001:2022 by April 1, 2024.  \n  \n\n  * Can choose to become certified to ISO 27001:2013, but this will not give them any additional time to transition to the new standard.  \n  \n\n  * It is important to note that the transition period is not a grace period. Organisations that do not transition to ISO 27001:2022 by October 31, 2025, will no longer be compliant with the standard, and their certificates will be invalid.\n\nHere are some additional things to keep in mind about the transition timeline:\n\n  * The transition period is designed to give organisations enough time to implement the changes required by ISO 27001:2022.  \n  \n\n  * However, organisations may need to start the transition process sooner if they have a significant amount of work to do.  \n  \n\n  * The transition process can be complex and challenging, so it is important to start planning early.  \n  \n\n  * There are a number of resources available to help organisations with the transition process, such as ISO's own guidance document.\n\n\n## What are the key changes in ISO 27001:2022?\n\nThe new edition of ISO 27001 introduces several significant changes,\nincluding:\n\nA focus on risk-based thinking: The new standard emphasizes the importance of\norganisations understanding their information security risks and taking steps\nto mitigate those risks. This is a major change from the previous version,\nwhich focused on a more prescriptive approach to information security.\n\nA greater emphasis on the importance of people and culture: The new standard\nrecognizes that people are a critical element of any information security\nprogram. It emphasizes the importance of creating a culture of information\nsecurity within the organisation. This includes things like training employees\non information security best practices and promoting a security-minded mindset\nthroughout the organisation.\n\nThe introduction of new controls to address emerging threats: The new standard\nincludes a number of new controls to address emerging threats, such as cloud\ncomputing, social engineering, and data breaches. These new controls are\ndesigned to help organisations stay ahead of the curve and protect their\ninformation assets from the latest threats.\n\nA new way of breaking down the standard: The new standard changes the layout\nof the Annex A controls to be broken down into smaller groups. These controls\nnow evolve around what they most protect and thus simplifying what was once a\nmore complicated breakdown.\n\n\n## What has changed in ISO 27001:2022?\n\nHere are some of the specific changes in each clause of the standard:\n\nContext and Scope: The scope clause now applies to \"relevant\" requirements of\ninterested parties and processes. This means that organisations need to\nconsider the needs of all of their stakeholders, not just their customers and\nsuppliers.\n\nPlanning: The planning clause now requires organisations to define their\ninformation security objectives and to monitor and review those objectives on\na regular basis. This is a change from the previous version, which only\nrequired organisations to define their information security policies.\n\nSupport: The support clause now requires organisations to define how they will\ncommunicate information security risks and issues to their staff. This is a\nnew requirement in the new standard.\n\nOperation: The operation clause now requires organisations to control\n\"externally provided processes, products, or services\" that are relevant to\ntheir ISMS. This is a change from the previous version, which only required\norganisations to control their own processes and systems.\n\n## The new structure of Annex A controls in ISO 27001:2022\n\nThe new edition of ISO 27001 restructures the Annex A controls into four\ncategories: organisational, people, physical, and technological. This is a\nsignificant improvement over the previous version, which had 14 control\ndomains. The new structure is designed to make it easier for organisations to\nselect and implement the controls that are most relevant to their needs.\n\n  * The organisational category contains 37 controls that address the overall management of information security within an organisation. These controls include things like establishing an information security policy, appointing a security manager, and conducting risk assessments.  \n  \n\n  * The people category contains 8 controls that address the role of people in information security. These controls include things like training employees on information security best practices, conducting background checks on new hires, and managing user access to sensitive information.  \n  \n\n  * The physical category contains 14 controls that address the physical security of information assets. These controls include things like securing buildings and facilities, protecting computer rooms, and managing the disposal of sensitive information.  \n  \n\n  * The technological category contains 34 controls that address the technological aspects of information security. These controls include things like implementing firewalls and antivirus software, encrypting data, and managing access to information systems.\n\nThe new structure of Annex A controls is aligned with the four pillars of\ninformation security:\n\n  * Organisational: This pillar addresses the need for a strong organisational commitment to information security.  \n  \n\n  * People: This pillar addresses the importance of people in information security.  \n  \n\n  * Physical: This pillar addresses the need to protect information assets from physical threats.  \n  \n\n  * Technological: This pillar addresses the need to protect information assets from technological threats.\n\nThe new structure of Annex A controls is a significant improvement over the\nprevious version. It makes it easier for organisations to implement an\neffective information security management system and protect their information\nassets from a wide range of threats.\n\nIn addition to the new structure, ISO 27001:2022 also includes 11 new\ncontrols. These controls are designed to address emerging threats, such as\ncloud computing, social engineering, and data breaches. The new controls are\nalso designed to improve the effectiveness of information security management\nsystems by providing organisations with more options for mitigating risks.\n\nThe new controls are as follows:\n\nThreat intelligence: This involves the collection and analysis of information\nabout potential threats to information security within organisations.\n\nInformation security for the use of cloud services: Assessing and managing the\nrisks associated with the use of cloud services.\n\nICT readiness for business continuity: Ensuring that information and\ncommunications technology (ICT) systems remain resilient and operational in\ndisaster scenarios is a requirement.\n\nPhysical security monitoring: Continually monitoring the physical security\nsystems to promptly identify and respond to security incidents.\n\nConfiguration management: Managing the configuration of their information\nsystems to ensure that they are secure.\n\nInformation deletion: Securely deleting sensitive information when it is no\nlonger needed.\n\nData masking: Masking sensitive information to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nData leakage prevention: Preventing sensitive information from being leaked\noutside of the organisation.\n\nMonitoring activities: Monitoring the information security activities to\nensure that they are effective.\n\nWeb filtering: Filtering web traffic to prevent access to malicious websites.\n\nSecure coding: Developing and using secure code to protect the information\nsystems.\n\nThrough these new Annex A controls, many organisations may be required to\nimplement 20+ new ISMS documents, policies and procedures into their ISMS\nbased on their scope and requirements.\n\n## Your roadmap to transition to ISO 27001:2022\n\nThe transition to ISO 27001:2022 can be a daunting task, but it is important\nto remember that it is a journey, not a destination. By following a structured\nroadmap, you can make the transition smoother and more successful.\n\nHere are the key steps in your roadmap to transition:\n\nRaise awareness: The first step is to raise awareness of the transition within\nyour organisation. This includes communicating the benefits of the new\nstandard, as well as the timeline and requirements for the transition.\n\nConduct a change analysis and gap assessment: Once you have raised awareness,\nyou need to conduct a change analysis and gap assessment. This will help you\nto identify the areas where your current information security management\nsystem (ISMS) needs to be updated to meet the requirements of ISO 27001:2022.\n\nReview and update documentation: Once you have identified the gaps, you need\nto review and update your ISMS documentation. This includes your policies,\nprocedures, and work instructions.\n\nPerform an internal audit: Once your documentation is updated, you need to\nperform an internal audit to ensure that your ISMS is compliant with the new\nstandard.\n\nConduct a transition gap assessment: After the internal audit, you need to\nconduct a transition gap assessment. This will help you to identify any\nremaining gaps that need to be addressed before you can transition to ISO\n27001:2022.\n\nUndergo a transition audit: Once you have addressed all of the gaps, you need\nto undergo a transition audit. This is a final check to ensure that your ISMS\nis compliant with the new standard.\n\nMaintain continuous improvement: Once you have transitioned to ISO 27001:2022,\nit is important to maintain continuous improvement. This means regularly\nreviewing your ISMS to ensure that it is still effective in protecting your\ninformation assets.\n\nIn addition to these key steps, there are a few other things you can do to\nmake the transition to ISO 27001:2022 smoother and more successful. These\ninclude (and are not limited to):\n\n  * Get buy-in from senior management.  \n  \n\n  * Involve all stakeholders in the transition process.  \n  \n\n  * Use a certified transition partner.  \n  \n\n  * Set realistic goals and milestones.  \n  \n\n  * Communicate regularly with stakeholders.  \n  \n\n  * By following these tips, you can make the transition to ISO 27001:2022 a success.\n\nHere are some additional proactive business advice:\n\n  * Use the transition as an opportunity to improve your overall information security posture.  \n  \n\n  * Consider using the transition as a way to consolidate or streamline your ISMS processes.  \n  \n\n  * Use the transition to communicate the importance of information security to your employees and other stakeholders.  \n  \n\n  * Use the transition to improve your organisation's risk management capabilities.\n\nBy taking a proactive approach to the transition, you can make it a valuable\nasset to your organisation.\n\n\nWhat is next for ISO 27001?\n\nAs is typical with ISO standards in general, they are all subject to updates\nover time, and ISO 27001:2022 will be no different.\n\nAs cybersecurity threats continue to grow \u2014 we can expect the standard to be\nreviewed more and more frequently.\n\nOn another note, with more focus on information security for the use of cloud\nservices, we can expect top cloud providers such as AWS, GCP and Microsoft\nAzure to start cloud-offering out-of-the-box compliance solutions to support\nwith the new ISO 27001:2022 through things like cloud configuration checks and\ndata leakage prevention solutions.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/2022-version-transition-guide/", "title": "Transition to ISO 27001:2022 [Step-by-Step Guide]", "description": "This guide provides a practical overview of the transition to ISO 27001:2022, the latest standard for information security management.", "language": "en-gb"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n## Introduction to ISO 27001 certification\n\nObtaining an ISO 27001 certification is the no.1 indicator to suppliers,\ncustomers, and stakeholders that you take information security seriously. It\u2019s\nalso a great starting point to set up a robust cyber strategy.\n\nNo matter if you\u2019re an SMB or a large-scale corporate, this guide compiles the\nmost relevant information all in one place.\n\n## What is ISO 27001?\n\nISO 27001 sets the global standard for an information security management\nsystem (ISMS) that pursues the ultimate goal of establishing a framework for\nkeeping information secure. In 2022, the ISO 27001:2013 version was updated to\nits latest version, the ISO 27001:2022.\n\nAn ISMS **creates a set of rules and procedures** that help mitigate the\ndamage of a cyber or ransomware attack as well as a security breach, which,\nnowadays, needs to be on every company's agenda.\n\nThe stats speak for themselves: During the third quarter of 2022, a staggering\n108.9 million accounts fell victim to breaches, marking a substantial 70%\nsurge compared to the preceding quarter. You can find the full report on What\nto expect in 2023: Trends and Predictions for Information Security here.\n\nUsing an ISO 27001-compliant ISMS lets you easily and affordably manage the\nsecurity of your organisation's data. Plus, it makes your customers,\ninvestors, and other important stakeholders feel confident that you're\nfollowing the best global practices for keeping information safe.\n\n## What is the ISO 27001 certification?\n\nThe ISO 27001 certification is granted when you meet the requirements of the\nISO 27001 standard. Once you've established your ISMS, an **independent\naccredited certification body** conducts an audit and **issues a certificate**\nupon successful completion. A certification body is basically an independent\ninstitution that can certify companies with the ISO 27001 certificate after\nsuccessfully passing an external audit.\n\nThe certification essentially **proves you** have taken the appropriate steps\nto **protect your most valuable information**. This includes intellectual\nproperty, trade secrets, proprietary data, and other valuable assets. While\nthe specific term \"intellectual property\" may not be used, the principles of\ninformation security within the ISO 27000 series standards are designed to\nencompass various forms of valuable and sensitive information, including\nintellectual property.\n\n## What is the ISO 27001:2022 standard?\n\nThe ISO 27001:2022 edition stands as the most recent iteration of ISO 27001,\nthe global benchmark for information security management systems that you must\nadhere to receive your certification. If you\u2019re already certified and need to\ntransition to the 2022 iteration, then our ISO 27001:2022 transition guide is\nyour go-to resource.\n\n## What is an ISMS?\n\nAn information security management system (ISMS) provides a framework of\n**documented policies, procedures, and controls** designed to **mitigate\ninformation security risks**. Once you\u2019ve built your ISMS, getting it\ncertified against an international standard such as ISO 27001 is best practice\n\n## How to establish and implement an ISMS?\n\nEstablishing and implementing an ISMS, in its simplest form, can be broken\ndown into 4 phases, also known as the PDCA cycle:\n\n  1. **Plan:** This is the phase in which you establish the ISMS, i.e. get your documentation in check.\n  2. **Do:** The processes and procedures you established in the plan phase, also need to be implemented and operated \u2014 this is what happens during the DO phase of the PDCA cycle.\n  3. **Check:** Then you check whether your ISMS aligns with the ISO 27001 standard and identify any gaps. This happens during internal and external audits.\n  4. **Act:** During this phase, you improve the ISMS and close any information security gaps to ensure you can obtain and keep your ISO 27001 certification.\n\n## Why is ISO 27001 important? Why get an ISO 27001 certification?\n\nThe certification is beneficial for a number of reasons; these are the most\nimportant ones:\n\n**Establishes stakeholder trust:**\n\nPossessing an ISO 27001 certificate demonstrates your dedication to\nsafeguarding information and underscores your business's credibility in\npartners' eyes. This can give you a competitive edge and enhance your brand\nreputation.\n\n**Assists legal compliance:**\n\nISO 27001 certification aids in meeting your various business, legal,\nfinancial, and regulatory commitments. By identifying statutory and regulatory\nrequisites, you can mitigate the likelihood of costly breaches, subsequently\nreducing the risk of expensive legal consequences and fines.\n\n**Secures personal data and intellectual property:**\n\nThe ISO 27001 certification process offers an impartial evaluation of your\ninformation security strategy. It could also assist in managing your\nintellectual property and data sources while creating tangible proof of\nimplementation.\n\nMitigates costly cyber-related data breaches:\n\nData breaches come with a hefty price tag. In 2023, the average cost of a data\nbreach was estimated at around $4.45 million (IBM, 2023). The ISO 27001\ncertification safeguards your information through established procedures and\nprocesses, helping you avoid such financial burdens.\n\nSets the foundation for reducing risk:\n\nRisk management is important to keep your business operations running and\nshould be carried out continuously. Yet setting up a risk management structure\nfrom scratch can be immensely time-consuming - ISO27001 gives you a framework\nto define the criteria of risk management in your company.\n\n## Who needs ISO 27001 certification?\n\nThe ISO 27001 certification is relevant for pretty much any business dealing\nwith information and data. It\u2019s not mandatory, yet it\u2019s common practice and\noften a prerequisite for many business stakeholders. This is because doing\nbusiness with you without relevant policies and procedures to manage risks\ncould put their information and data at risk.\n\nIndustries particularly affected by ransomware and cyber-attacks and where ISO\n27001 certification is becoming the norm include:\n\n  * Education/Research\n  * Government/Military aka. the Public sector\n  * MedTech/Healthcare\n  * Communications\n\nYet, with the current upward trend of cyber criminality, all businesses \u2014 from\nSMBs to large-scale corporates - need to consider information security. And\ngetting ISO 27001 certified is a clear roadmap to making it a priority.\n\n## How hard is it to get ISO 27001 certified?\n\nGetting ISO 27001 isn't easy by default \u2014 in fact, the process does come with\nits complexities, especially with plenty of stakeholders and complicated\nprocesses involved.\n\nFurthermore, ISO 27001 certification is usually a top-down decision, which\nmeans that top management must be involved in the process sooner or later. As\na business, you should ensure that you have the right experience within the\nteam to convince decision-makers about the certification and to navigate the\nwhole process.\n\n## Common pitfalls to avoid when getting ISO 27001 certification\n\nAs an organisation, implementing ISO 27001 provides you with several benefits\nincluding easier compliance with legal requirements, better security for data,\nand improved stakeholder confidence. The catch: successful implementation of\nthe standard can be a major challenge to organisations doing it for the first\ntime.  \n\nSince the ISO 27001 standard is designed to be customisable to your\norganisation, there are several instances where businesses could go wrong in\ntheir implementation process. Based on our extensive experience of working\nwith varied clients, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the most common pitfalls\nbusinesses face when implementing the standard along with advice on what you\ncan do to avoid them.\n\n**Not defining the right scope**\n\nFinding the right scope for implementing your organisation\u2019s ISMS can be\ntricky. Organisations often set over-ambitious goals for the implementation of\ntheir ISMS, leading to the adoption of several redundant and unneeded controls\nand processes.\n\nThis can lead to resource wastage, increased cost of information security, and\ndemotivated employees chasing unachievable targets. On the other hand, an\norganisation may define their scope too narrowly, and the needed controls may\nnot be adopted. This could lead to noncompliance with the ISO 27001 standard\nand can make it appear that your organisation is not in control of its ISMS\nduring the certification audit.\n\n**Lack of management**\n\nCommitment In many organisations, implementing the ISO 27001 is considered to\nbe an IT exercise and the responsibility of the IT department of the business.\nIn reality, it is a management standard for information security. The upper\nmanagement in an organisation may not see the value the implementation of ISO\n27001 adds to the business and they may be hesitant to fully commit to its\nimplementation.\n\n**Too few resources**\n\nOften, the implementation of the ISO 27001 falls to a particular individual or\nteam within the organisation. This type of approach can create information\nsecurity silos where only very few individuals are aware of the controls and\nprocedures around the ISMS and other aspects of the standard. The loss of such\nindividuals could cause the collapse of the entire ISMS.\n\nFind out which two other pitfalls are common for all businesses and how you\ncan prevent these pitfalls from happening in our free guide about the most\ncommon pitfalls during ISO 27001 Certification.\n\n## How long does it take to get ISO 27001 certified?\n\nUsually, the process can take 6 to 12 months, depending on business size and\ncomplexity. The use of designated solutions, can\nfasten the process to as little as 3 months (also depending on a business\u2019\nproperties).\n\nThis phase is called the ramp-up phase, where the main chunk of work is done.\nYou carry out a gap analysis that aims to close up to 50% of your company's\nmost significant risks in as little as 8 weeks.\n\nGetting through the process involves:\n\n  * Defining your scope\n  * Building your Information Security Management System (ISMS)\n  * Identifying and managing risks\n  * Protecting your information assets\n  * Passing your ISO 27001 audit\n  * Maintaining your ISMS, keeping your certificate\n\nAlso, if you're in the mindset of scaling, we definitely recommend getting\nstarted sooner rather than later. Scaling your ISMS alongside your company\ngrowth is easier.\n\n## Does the ISO 27001 certification expire?\n\nThe ISO 27001 certification needs to be **renewed every 3 years**. Yet, it\u2019s\nrecommended to **remain compliant to protect** your company\u2019s assets and\nensure your information remain safe. Furthermore, companies must pass the\nannual surveillance audit to verify compliance and to avoid expiry of the\ncertification before the three years cycle.\n\n_\u201c_ _If an organization does not pass the surveillance audit conducted by the\nexternal auditor, their ISO 27001 certification could potentially expire\nbefore the full 3-year term is completed. The surveillance audits are\ntypically conducted annually to ensure ongoing compliance with the ISO 27001\nstandard. If compliance is not maintained, the certification might not be\nrenewed for the full 3-year period_ _._ _\u201d  \nLarissa Bruns, _Associate Consultant Tech Practice Professional Services\n\n## How do I transition to ISO 27001:2022?\n\nIf you already comply with the ISO 27001:2013 certification you don\u2019t\nnecessarily need a separate audit to transition to the new revision. You can\neither undergo a standalone transition audit or you can opt for a transition\naudit at the time of annual surveillance or re-certification. This depends on\nwhere you are in the certification lifecycle.\n\nHere is an overview of a typical transition roadmap:\n\nWhen it comes to the transitioning timeline, the 2022 revision was issued in\nOctober last year and the transitioning timeline has officially begun. By\nOctober 2023, UKAs plans to have transitioned all certification bodies to the\nnew standard.\n\nAll 2013 certificates will expire on the 31st October 2025, this is the\ndeadline to transition. Your will have to undergo a transitioning audit before\nthis date, so ensure your company has allocated enough time for this\ntransition. Yet you can still certify against the 2013 standard until April\n2024, if you wish to do so.\n\nComplying with the new 2022 standard is bound to save your organisation\nresources and frustrations. This is why we recommend transitioning sooner\nrather than later.\n\n* * *\n\n## What are the benefits of getting ISO 27001 certified?\n\nThe benefits of implementing ISO 27001 are plenty \u2014 both for your business and\nexternal parties and stakeholders. Here's an overview of the most important\nones:\n\nThe benefits of achieving ISO 27001 certification:\n\n  * Your company or organisation can avoid significant financial losses caused by ransomware attacks.\n  * Win more deals; having a certified information security system can set you apart from the competition and win trust among potential customers.\n  * You may be able to secure investment more easily; investors are becoming more and more aware of the threats ransomware attacks have.\n  * By getting certified, you can experience increased customer trust because, nowadays, tech-savvy customers want to know how you handle data safely.\n  * Promising to keep your customer's data safe can become your brand's unique selling point.\n  * Reduced risk of data breaches: By having the proper measures in place \u2014 you can avoid the risk of a breach before it even happens.\n  * Setting up processes and procedures when it comes to how you handle data can also mean increased operational efficiency. Because now you have a standard process instead of different methods.\n  * Enhanced brand reputation: Customers want to know how you handle their information, and getting ISO 27001 certified is the ultimate promise that you take information security seriously.\n\n### Is ISO 27001 compliance sufficient?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to establish an information security management system \u2014 ISO\n27001 is the ultimate baseline that will cover most businesses' compliance and\ninformation security needs.\n\nWhat your customers and suppliers require will depend on where your business\noperates. ISO 27001 is an internationally recognised standard known as the\ngold standard, regardless of geographic location or industry. It should be\nsufficient for every use case, but if you are unsure \u2014 having an initial\nconsult with an information security expert makes sense.\n\n## Getting ISO 27001 certified\n\n**Accredited vs. non-accredited certification**\n\nAs we have learned so far, ISO 27001 certification is not mandatory for\nbusinesses. However, it\u2019s recommended to be compliant with the standard at\nleast. But what\u2019s the difference between being certified and being compliant?\nIn general, you must understand the three ways of communicating the\nimplementation of ISO 27001:\n\n  * ISO 27001 compliant\n  * ISO 27001 certified\n  * ISO 27001 certified by an officially accredited certification body\n\nThe difference is that an independent third certification body validates an\naccredited certification **.** A non-accredited certification means you have\nimplemented the ISO standards but have not undergone an external audit, nor\nhave you been issued a certificate for an external certified body.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, numerous accredited certification bodies for ISO 27001\nexist. These bodies have undergone scrutiny and accreditation by UKAS, the\ncountry's national accreditation authority. UKAS guarantees organisational\ncompetence and adherence to the highest standards, utilising a thorough audit\nprocess to ensure compliance.\n\nOften, certain contractual agreements require an official accredited\ncertification. Apart from this, **achieving an accredited certification is\nhighly recommended** \u2014 you can use it in your communications towards customers\nand have an external assess your information security to ensure your ISMS is\nin check.\n\nWe strongly **recommend seeking certification exclusively through accredited\nbodies**. Business partners often do not acknowledge certifications lacking\nconfirmation from an international accreditation body. In fact, most contracts\nmandating ISO 27001 certification implicitly refer to certification by an\naccredited body. Read more about accredited bodies here.\n\n## Conducting a risk assessment\n\nConducting a risk assessment is not as straightforward as one might think.\nFirst of all, there are many different approaches to risk assessments. It\u2019s\nnot necessarily common practice, but **scenario-based** is the **most\neffective way to access risk**. This means considering past occurrences and\nanalysing risky scenarios that may cause an issue.\n\nThe risk assessment consists of the following:\n\n  1. Identify & assess risk\n  2. Treat risks - you decide here how you want to address the risks. E.g., Accept, Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate.\n  3. Review residual risks.\n\n# Implementing controls and a risk treatment plan to manage risks\n\nAn integral element of your information security program is the **risk\ntreatment plan**. This plan is all-encompassing and is devised to execute\nmeasures to either accept, avoid, transfer, or **mitigate the possibility or\nconsequences of risks**.\n\nOf utmost importance within a risk treatment plan is the aspect of\nimplementation. Its significance lies in guaranteeing the actual execution of\nrisk treatment procedures.\n\n## Complete your ISMS Documentation\n\nDocumentation is the basis of your ISMS and the most important part of getting\nand maintaining your certification. If it's not documented, it's not relevant.\n\nYou need to keep track of many things when it comes to documentation, as there\nare many things to consider. To give you a complete overview of the\ndocumentation required for ISO 27001 certification, along with information on\npreparing said documentation, we have created a detailed list for the\ndocumentation:\n\n**Definition of the scope of application of the ISMS (Information Security\nManagement System)**\n\nThe scope of application of the ISMS is defined in the so-called \u201cScope\nDocument\u201d. This determines which divisions of your company are subject to the\nISMS. Your ISMS doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be rolled out across the entire\ncompany - only the relevant departments and divisions. That said, in the case\nof smaller companies, it will usually cover all departments.\n\n**Coordination and documentation of the guideline on information security**\n\nThe objectives which your company seeks to achieve with your ISMS should be\nclearly defined in the guideline on information security. This document should\nalso demonstrate why information security is a top priority in your\norganisation, and that management is responsible for the guideline.\n\nThis does not have to be formulated by management themselves but must always\nbe approved by the necessary stakeholders. The ISO standard already specifies\nthe following information security objectives:\n\n  * Data confidentiality\n  * Data availability\n  * Data integrity\n\n**Definition of risk assessment and risk management methods**\n\nYou will need to identify your company\u2019s risks, assess them individually and\ndefine an appropriate methodology for risk management. The assessment should\nalways be carried out by the respective risk owner and should ultimately be\napproved by management.\n\nIn addition, this area should be coordinated within the company, ideally with\nyour ISO, CISO or risk management department. Given that this process must be\nrepeated on a regular basis, it can result in a lot of effort, especially for\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises that lack in-house security and risk\nexperts. Repetitions occur when there are new assets in the company that\nrequire a risk assessment.\n\n**Preparing a declaration of applicability**\n\nAs part of this step the ISO/CISO shall agree, with the respective specialist\ndepartments, which of the 93 controls stated in Appendix A of ISO 27001:2022\nmust be carried out or which are relevant for the company.\n\nISO 27001 has specified various areas such as cryptography, HR security or\noperational security. Companies may exclude some of these areas by providing\nappropriate justification. For example, if a business does not have a loading\nzone, it is simply not necessary to draw up rules for loading zones.\n\nDownload our free E-Book to learn about all 22 documentation requirements.\n\nIf you choose to work with experts such as DataGuard or an external\nconsultant, you may receive documentation templates that will help cut down on\nyour manual work significantly compared to creating them from scratch.\n\n## What is an audit, and why is it important?\n\nAn audit is basically the process of checking that your ISMS meets the\nrequirements and criteria of a standard. If you are certifying against ISO\n27001, it will be the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard.\n\nAudits ensure the success of your ISMS by identifying information security\nnon-conformities and can be either internal or external. Internal audits can\nbe carried out using the organisations\u2019 own resources \u2014 whether that\u2019s\ninternal employees of the company or contracted independent consultants (2nd\nparty auditors).\n\nExternal audits are carried out by a certification body, external partners or\ncustomers who want to assess the ISMS on their own terms. The latter is rather\nthe exception than the rule \u2014 when referring to an external audit, a\ncertification body is meant in most cases.\n\nAudits are incredibly important not only because they are:\n\n  * **A concrete **requirement** of the ISO 27001 standard.**\n  * The only way of **verifying whether you comply** with the standard.\n  * Necessary to **obtain your ISO 27001 certification.**\n\n## Conducting internal audits:  \nHow to go about it\n\nInternal audits are vital for long-term success in earning and keeping your\nISO 27001 certification. They should be carried out on a regular basis by\nemployees within the company, as opposed to external auditors coming into your\ncompany to assess your ISMS.\n\nHowever, independency and qualification are a must for being an internal\nauditor. Another option is to perform internal audits with external\nconsultants, like the experts at DataGuard, who also offer regular audits.\nInternal audits are your best bet for catching gaps in your documentation and\nimproving it.\n\nWhen you are getting certified for the first time, the internal audit ensures\nyou have everything you need in place to pass your certification on the first\ntry.\n\nAn internal audit checklist will help you keeping an overview of the necessary\nsteps in that process. Here is an overview of the steps in an internal audit:\n\n  1. **Documentation Review**\n    * All documentation from the management and control system should be reviewed to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and up-to-date.\n    * A team should be assigned to perform this task.\n    * The team should be given a clear set of instructions to follow while they are performing the review.\n    * The documentation should be examined for completeness, accuracy, consistency, and suitability for its intended purpose.\n    * The auditor will then check to see if you have the required documents and that it complies with the standards.\n  2. **Management Review**\n    * The management review team should go through the documentation again to make sure that all relevant information has been recorded and that there are no omissions or missing information in any of the documents.\n    * Finally, management needs to look over the report and take the audit results into account. Make sure that any essential changes and corrective measures are put into place.\n\nGet a full breakdown of how to conduct an internal audit.\n\n## Undergoing external audits: What to expect\n\nYou will be in touch with your auditor before the external audit takes place\nto agree on an audit that includes resources and timelines for the audit.\n\nIn general, there are four types of external audits:\n\n  * **Stage 1 Audit:** This is the documentation review audit, whereby the external auditor analyses if your organisation has all the necessary documentation in place for a fully functioning ISMS. Your documents need to cover the documentation required in the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. The certification body will take the time to gain a sufficient understanding of the ISMS design in the context of your organization, risk assessment and treatment (including the controls determined), information security policy and objectives. A large emphasis will also be put on your company's preparedness for the audit. This allows planning for stage 2.  \n  \n\n  * **Stage 2 Audit:** Based on documented findings in stage 1's audit report, the certification body will develop an audit plan to conduct stage 2 of the audit. In addition to evaluating the effective implementation of the ISMS, the aim of stage 2 is to confirm that your company adheres to its own policies, objectives and procedures.\n\nTo do this, the audit will focus on:\n\n  * Top management leadership and commitment to information security policy and the information security objectives\n  * Documentation requirements listed in ISO/IEC 27001\n  * Assessment of information security-related risks and that the assessments produce consistent, valid and comparable results if repeated\n  * Determination of control objectives and controls based on the information security risk assessment Risk treatment processes\n  * Information security performance and the effectiveness of the ISMS, evaluating against the information security objectives\n  * Correspondence between the determined controls, the Statement of Applicability and the results of the information security risk assessment and risk treatment process and the information security policy and objectives\n  * Implementation of controls (see Annex A), taking into account the external and internal context\n  * And related risks, the organization\u2019s monitoring, measurement and analysis of information security\n  * Processes and controls to determine whether controls are implemented and effective and meet their stated information security objectives\n  * Programmes, processes, procedures, records, internal audits and reviews of the ISMS effectiveness to ensure that these are traceable to top management decisions and the information security policy and objectives\n\nOnce you have completed stage two and passed the audit \u2014 you will receive your\nofficial certification.\n\n  * Surveillance/periodic audits: happen between certification and recertification audits focusing on specific areas of the ISMS. This is done every year.\n  * Recertification audit: This is necessary to keep your certification and covers all aspects of the standard and must be carried out every 3 years.\n\n## How long does it take to get ready for an ISO 27001 external audit?\n\nDepending on the size of your company or organisation, you can be audit-ready\nin about 8 weeks. If you decide to go the manual route of building your\ndocumentation from scratch, it can take at least approximately 4 months.\n\nThere are a few main requirements you need to fulfil to obtain your ISO 27001.\nTo help you with it, we\u2019ve compiled a series of checklists which outline\neverything you\u2019ll need for your certification.\n\n  * **1 to 20 employees - Up to 3 months**\n  * **20 to 50 employees \u2013 3 to 5 months**\n  * **50 to 200 employees - 5 to 8 months**\n  * **More than 200 employees - 8 to 20 months**\n\nIt is also important to take into account several other variables that may\naffect the time it takes for you to obtain the certification.\n\n  * The number of individuals on the ISMS implementation project (relative to the size of the business)\n  * The amount of time individuals are willing to spend on the project\n  * Engagement / endorsement / support from leadership\n  * The size of the company and complexity\n  * Auditor availability to conduct the external audit\n\nWhen implementing your ISMS, you may experience unforeseen challenges which\nmay delay certification as well.\n\n## What you can expect at an external audit\n\nOnce you've successfully run through an internal audit, there's not much more\nyou need to expect from an external auditor in terms of process. An auditor\nwill come to your company premises, review your ISMS and speak with your\nemployees.\n\nHere\u2019s the overall process:\n\n**1\\. Document check**\n\nFirst, the external auditor will review all of your ISMS-related\ndocumentation. It has now also become the norm that auditors can do this\nremotely. But in fact, inviting them to physically come into your company so\nthey can get to know your team builds trust early on.\n\n**2\\. On-site audit**\n\nIn the second step, an on-site inspection is carried out. Some of your\nemployees will be interviewed, and your systems will also be randomly checked.\nIn addition to employees such as your CISO/ISB, who directly deal with the\nISMS, your CFO or CEO should give the auditor confidence that the financial\nresources for operating the ISMS are firmly set up.\n\nYou will already know during the inspection whether you\u2019re going to pass the\naudit and receive the certification, as the auditor will directly address\nminor and perhaps even significant issues.\n\nAfterwards, the certification body first has to prove all non-conformities\naddressed by the auditor, which usually gives you the chance to improve your\ndocumentation before an official result of the audit is confirmed..\n\nMajor non-conformance will lead to a failed audit. The only thing left is to\nset the date and conditions for a follow-up audit together.\n\n**3\\. Audit Report and ISO 27001 Certificate**\n\nFinally, you will receive an audit report and the certificate from your\nauditor. Many certification companies are currently busy, so this may take a\nfew months.\n\n## What happens if you fail the external audit?\n\nThe external auditor will usually give you an indication during your external\naudit whether you are likely to pass or fail the audit. Major nonconformities\nmay lead to a failed external audit \u2014 although this might seem like a major\nsetback, it needs to be seen as an opportunity to improve.\n\nWhen it comes to the 2022 version of ISO 27001, there are 93 Annex A controls\nthat cover various areas of an organisation. These controls are segmented into\n4 different categories (domains). Depending on which are relevant for your\ncompany, risks, industry and customers \u2014 you will fulfil the requirements in\nspecific annexes.\n\nYou will receive an audit report; this will be your go-to to identify what you\nneed to change in order to pass your next external audit. It is also\nrecommended to speak with the auditors for further clarification on what\nprecisely needs to be improved.\n\nIn general, nonconformities are classed as:\n\n  * Major non-conformities\n  * Minor non-conformities\n  * Opportunities for improvement\n\nThere is no direct penalty for not passing an external audit, but not\nachieving certification may result in improper risk management, reputational\ndamages and additional financial costs. Preparing thoroughly and undergoing\ninternal audits significantly reduce the risk of failing. If you happen to\nhave failed an audit in the past, we recommend the following:\n\n  * Assessing your audit report\n  * Discussing the outcome with the external auditor\n  * Communicating the outcomes and reasoning to all relevant stakeholders and ensuring internal alignment\n  * Establishing an action plan with prioritized tasks, also sorted by due date and responsible persons\n  * Initiating the entire process of setting and improving your ISMS again; ensuring enough relevant resources are available, especially for internal auditing\n  * Once the scope of improving your ISMS is clear, set a date for your next external audit\n\n## What are the ISO 27001 certification requirements?\n\nThe main requirements when it comes to the ISO 27001 certification are:\ndocumentation, undergoing audits and ensuring your employees adopt the\nprocesses.\n\n**Documentation** includes the creation and maintenance of necessary\ndocumentation for your Information Security Management System (ISMS), such as\npolicies, procedures, risk assessments, and controls.\n\n**Undergoing audits** includes both the Stage 1 Audit, which reviews\ndocumentation and readiness, and the Stage 2 Audit, which assesses the\npractical implementation of your ISMS. Successful completion of these audits\nis necessary to achieve ISO 27001 certification. You will also be required to\nundergo internal audits and management reviews.\n\nIt's also crucial to **communicate the processes effectively** This is to\nensure that your organization's information security practices align with the\nISO 27001 standards. You will need to have the documentation in place but also\nput the processes into action by ensuring employees are aware of and follow\nthem.\n\nThe mandatory documents required for the ISO 27001 standard are listed below.\nAll criteria must be followed and documented accordingly for an organisation\nto present during external audits. The standard requires you to undergo an\ninternal audit before an external one. This will expose any gaps in your ISMS.\n\nOnce you have prepared the documentation and undergone an internal audit as\nwell as a management review, you need to undergo an external audit by a\ncertified body such as the UKAS.\n\nThe mandatory documents required for ISO 27001 are:\n\n  * 4.1 Understanding the organization and its context\n  * 4.2 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties\n  * 4.3 The scope of the ISMS\n  * 4.4 Information Security Management System process\n  * 5.1 Commitment of the ISMS\n  * 5.2 Information security policy\n  * 5.3 Roles and their responsibilities (RACI/RASCI)\n  * 6.1.2 Information security risk assessment and treatment process\n  * 6.1.3 Information security risk treatment and assessment plan\n  * 6.1.3 The Statement of Applicability\n  * 6.2 Information security objectives\n  * 6.3 Change Management for the ISMS\n  * 7.1 Ressource planning\n  * 7.3 Awareness plan\n  * 7.4 Communication Plan\n  * 7.2 Evidence of competence\n  * 7.5 Document control policy\n  * 5.5.1 Documented information determined by the organisation as being necessary for the effectiveness of the ISMS\n  * 8.1 Operational planning and control\n  * 8.2 Results of the information security risk assessment\n  * 8.3 Results of the information security risk treatment\n  * 9.1 Evidence of the monitoring and measurement of results\n  * 9.2 A documented internal audit process\n  * 9.2 Evidence of the audit programmes and the audit results\n  * 9.3 Evidence of the results of management reviews\n  * 10.1 Evidence of the nature of the non-conformities and any subsequent actions taken\n  * 10.1 Evidence of the results of any corrective actions\n\nTo get a full breakdown of the ISO 27001 requirements, check the ISO 27001\nrequirements: A comprehensive list.\n\n## What are ISO 27001 controls, and how to go about implementation?\n\nA control is a measure that manages risk.\n\nWhen it comes to the 2022 version of ISO 27001, there are 93 Annex A controls\nthat cover various areas of an organisation. These controls are segmented into\n4 different categories (domains). Depending on which are relevant for your\ncompany, risks, industry and customers \u2014 you will fulfil the requirements in\nspecific annexes.\n\nStandard controls include:\n\n  * 8 asset management\n  * 14 system acquisition development and maintenance\n  * 10 cryptography\n  * 18 compliance\n\n## The costs of ISO 27001 certification\n\nThe price or costs for getting ISO 27001 certified depends on many things.\nThese are the most relevant influences on what you will need to invest in your\nISO 27001 certification:\n\n  * The level of maturity reflected in the ISMS.\n  * The range of activities conducted within the defined boundaries of the ISMS.\n  * The extent of technology utilisation across the various facets of the ISMS.\n  * The degree of external sourcing and engagements with third-party entities covered by the ISMS.\n  * The variance between the current state and the intended state of the control environment.\n  * The internal capacity of the organisation to enhance the ISMS and address identified deficiencies.\n  * The requested timeline for getting certified.\n\nThis is why we cannot provide a one-size-fits-all answer \u2014 yet we can give\nindications that will help establish a budget.\n\n### How much does it cost to get ISO 27001 certified?\n\nThe cost of getting certified can be broken down into three phases:\nimplementation (of your ISMS), internal auditing and certification.\n\n**Internal costs**\n\nThese costs can include:\n\n  * Internal staff costs\n  * Consultation costs\n  * Management resources for reviews and communication\n  * Project management and awareness-building resources among staff\n  * Software tools to support the establishment of an ISMS\n\n**External costs**\n\nThis generally refers to the auditor's cost; on average, the cost of auditing\nper day is \u00a31000 \u2014 the number of days and whether you will have a remote or\non-site audit will impact external costs.\n\n### Example breakdown of ISO 27001 certification cost\n\nBelow, you can find an example breakdown of costs you can expect in each\nphase:\n\n**Implementation**\n\n  * Precertification Phase I (Scope, Definition, Risk Assessment, Risk treatment plan, Gap assessment), Phase II (remediation plan) - \u00a315, 000\n  * Precertification Phase II (Gap closure, Registrar Selection, ISMS artefact development, Risk management committee, Incident response, Internal ISMS audit, On-Site certification audit support) - \u00a310,000\n  * Average annual Compliance Manager salary (US) - \u00a3100,000 (depends on whether your organisation employs this position or not)\n  * Average annual cost of compliance software and tools - \u00a315,000 to \u00a3100,000\n\n**Internal auditing**\n\n  * Compliance consultant cost - \u00a3140/hour, for about 24 to 160 consulting hours\n\n**Certification**\n\n  * ISO 27001 Auditor cost - \u00a35,500 to \u00a318,000\n\n**Surveillance Audit Cost**\n\n  * Annual Compliance Specialist salary - \u00a375,000 to \u00a390,000\n  * Cost of IS0 27001 audit - \u00a35,500 to \u00a312,000\n\nThe total cost of the ISO 27001 certification ranges from \u00a310,000 to \u00a348,000.\nTo budget your own ISO 27001 certification, we recommend doing as much\nresearch as possible, getting quotes from different stakeholders and comparing\nprices. Tactics such as leveraging software tools that streamline the\ncertification process can significantly trim your budget.\n\n## Is the investment worth it?\n\nAccording to Statista, the global average cost per data breach is USD 4.35\nmillion as of 2022. If that's a hit your company or organisation can easily\ntake \u2014 getting ISO certified might not be worth it.\n\nInformation security is bound to become more and more important and simply\nshouldn't be ignored. As ransomware and cyberattacks rise year after year,\ncompanies realise that a preventive approach might be better than cleaning up\nthe reputational and financial mess once something does happen.\n\nOf course, you will need to take your unique ROI of getting ISO 27001\ncertified into account. Speaking with an information security expert can give\nyou an idea of what you can expect cost-wise and whether it's worth investing\nin.\n\nAt the same time, how you go about getting certified- e.g., using a process-\ndriven platform backed by experts or hiring a compliance manager in-house \u2014\nwill have a significant impact on just how much you need to invest and whether\nit will be worth it in the long run.\n\n* * *\n\n## How to get started with ISO 27001 certification\n\nAs you can see, there are plenty of aspects you need to think about when it\ncomes to achieving ISO 27001 certification. But **the best time to get started\nis now**. Let your ISMS grow and scale with you.\n\nThe recommended and common practice to start your ISO 27001 journey is to:\n\n  * **Find a qualified consultant** and/or platform to get an initial consultation so you can get clear on the scope, costs and timeline you can expect for your company.\n  * Develop a **project plan and timeline** where all the relevant stakeholders are named.\n  * Ensure a **buy-in from management.** Information security needs to be approached holistically to protect the entire company's assets, so have a game plan to get the whole team's green light and active involvement.\n  * Start defining your scope and **work your way through** **the certification steps**.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001-certification/", "title": "ISO 27001 Certification: Your ultimate guide [free guide available]", "description": "No matter if you\u2019re an SMB or an international corporation \u2014 getting an ISO 27001 certification should be on your agenda.

{"page_content": "\n## ISO 27001 Annex A controls \u2013 A detailed guide\n\nISO 27001 is a framework of best practices implemented through an information\nsecurity management system (ISMS). ISO 27001 certification can help businesses\nimprove their information security processes, mitigate risks and build trust\namong customers and stakeholders.\n\nWith the help of this standard, companies protect their information assets and\nimplement effective measures to keep their data safe. All risks considered -\ntechnological, organisational, physical and people.\n\nTo use the standard successfully, companies and managers must identify their\nown risks and know the proper measures to take. We have compiled a handy\noverview of all 93 controls and 4 categories of measures to help you get\nstarted. Learn more about the most important ways to protect your information.\n\n\n## What is ISO 27001, and why should companies adopt it?\n\nISO 27001 is a universal framework for managing information security. The\ncertification is considered an international standard and guides your\nbusiness\u2019s information security management system (ISMS). It provides guidance\nfor establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving a\ncompany\u2019s ISMS, which helps organisations protect their information assets. In\n2022, the standard was revised for the third time. The current version of the\nstandard is ISO 27001:2022.\n\nThis framework, ISO 27001, safeguards the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of the sensitive consumer information you collect. Compliance\nwith ISO 27001 helps you prevent unauthorised access, breaches and regulatory\nfines.\n\nMoreover, achieving ISO 27001 certification not only ensures robust\ninformation security but also aligns with the requirements of NIS2, the new EU\nDirective, emphasising its importance in the current digital landscape.\n\n## What is the ISO 27001 Annex A?\n\nA simple approach to think of Annex A is as a portfolio of information\nsecurity controls that you can choose from \u2013 you can pick and select from 93\nmeasures specified in Annex A that are relevant to your organisation\u2019s scope.\n\nISO 27001 Annex A is arguably the most well-known annex of all the ISO\nstandards, as it contains the essential instrument for managing information\nsecurity risks: a list of security controls (or safeguards) that should be\nused to strengthen the security of information assets.\n\nThe 27001 Annex A lists all relevant controls and provides guidance on how to\nimplement the standard measures.\n\n## ISO 27001 vs. ISO 27002: What is the difference?\n\nISO 27001 is the framework that gives companies a basic understanding of the\ncontrols and clauses in Annex A. While it does not go into great depth\nregarding each control, it does provide you with an idea of what you need to\naccomplish, but not how to execute it. Each control has a one-line explanation\nof its aim.\n\nThe ISO 27000 standard additionally includes elaborations that focus more\nclosely on the respective controls. ISO 27002, therefore, outlines the\nspecific controls organisations can choose to implement to establish a\ncompliant ISMS. While ISO 27001 includes Annex A and briefly discusses the\nseparate controls, ISO 27002 goes into more detail. It covers the objective\nfor each control, explains how it works and elaborates on how companies are\nexpected to achieve compliance successfully.\n\n## ISO 27001:2022 Annex A Controls\n\nThe ISO 27001 framework includes Annex A, which incorporates the list of\ncontrols and measurements that can be taken to establish a strong information\nsecurity framework depending on the company\u2019s context.\n\nThe overall objective of the ISO 27001 framework is to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. The\nimplementation enables organisations to:\n\nComply with ever-changing legal requirements through a single framework\n\nDemonstrate prioritised information security and gain a competitive advantage\n\nPrevent security incidents and avoid costly fines\n\nDefine processes and job roles and improve organisational structure\n\nBut what are the controls, and how do you use them effectively?\n\n### ISO 27001:2022: Eleven new controls\n\nSince 2022, eleven new controls have been added to ISO 27001, which are\nassigned to different categories. Organisations are required to:\n\nA.5.7 Threat intelligence\n\nCollect and analyse data on potential threats to maintain information security\n\nA.5.23 Information security for the use of cloud services\n\nDefine and monitor information security for the use of cloud services.\n\nA.5.30 ICT readiness for business continuity\n\nCreate an ICT (information and communications technology) continuity plan to\nmaintain business resilience.\n\nA.7.4 Physical security monitoring\n\nImplement appropriate monitoring tools to detect and prevent external and\ninternal intrusions.\n\nA.8.9 Configuration management\n\nEstablish policies for documenting, implementing, monitoring and auditing\nconfigurations across their network.\n\nA.8.10 Information deletion\n\nManage data deletion to comply with laws and regulations.\n\nA.8.11 Data masking\n\nUse data masking techniques for personal identifiable information (PII) to\ncomply with laws and regulations.\n\nA.8.12 Data leakage prevention\n\nTake technical measures to identify and prevent the disclosure and/or\nextraction of information.\n\nA.8.16 Monitoring activities\n\nImprove network monitoring activities to detect anomalous behaviour and\nrespond to security events and incidents.\n\nA.8.23 Web filtering\n\nEnforce access controls and measures to restrict and control access to\nexternal websites.\n\nA.8.28 Secure coding\n\nImplement proven principles of secure coding to prevent vulnerabilities that\ncould be caused by inadequate coding methods.\n\n### ISO 27001: 4 Control sets\n\nTo make things easier, controls in Annex A are categorised into different\ngroups. That divides the context of the controls and the domain of the\napplicable risks. But what are the relevant categories and where do they\napply?\n\nThere are 93 ISO 27001 Annex A controls that cover multiple areas of an\norganisation, and these controls are segmented into four different categories\n(domains).\n\nThese control sets can be selectively applied to your organisation based on\nthe risk assessment results.\n\nEach category can be attributed to a particular focus area within your\norganisation. Contrary to popular belief, they are not all IT-related.\n\nGrouping the controls into four themes helps organisations decide who is\nresponsible for implementing the measures and which measures apply to their\nrespective organisation. For example, technical controls can be carried out by\nthe IT department, while organisational controls can be carried out by your\nsystem operations team.\n\nTo achieve a better overview, here is a list of the four different categories\nof controls:\n\n  * Organisational controls (37 measures)  \n  \n\n  * People controls (8 measures)  \n  \n\n  * Physical controls (14 actions)  \n  \n\n  * Technological controls (34 measures)\n\n### Organisational Controls: Measurements for organisational safety\n\nOrganisational controls typically cover everything that does not fall under\nthe topics of people, technology, or physical security. This includes things\nlike identity management, responsibilities, and evidence collection.\n\nNew organisational controls include:\n\n5.7: Threat Intelligence\n\n5.23: Information security for use of cloud services\n\n5.30: ICT readiness for business continuity\n\nThreat Intelligence in particular is an exciting innovation in this area - as\nthis measure goes beyond detecting malicious domain names. Threat intelligence\nhelps organisations better understand how they can be attacked.\n\n### People controls: Staff-related measures to protect staff.\n\nThe people controls section comprises only eight controls. It focuses on how\nemployees handle sensitive information during their daily work. This includes\ntopics like remote work, nondisclosure agreements and screenings. Onboarding\nand offboarding processes, as well as responsibilities for reporting\nincidents, are also relevant.\n\n### Physical Controls: Physical measures for the physical protection of the\norganisation.\n\nPhysical controls include security monitoring, maintenance, facility security\nand storage media. This category is about how you protect against physical and\nenvironmental threats such as theft, natural disasters, and deliberate\ndestruction.\n\nThe new physical controls include: 7.4: Physical security monitoring.\n\n### Technological Controls: Technological measures for technical security.\n\nTechnological controls cover the areas of authentication, encryption, and data\nleakage prevention. Technology must be properly secured to protect data.\nVarious approaches, such as access rights, network security and data masking,\nhelp to achieve this.\n\nNew technology controls include:\n\n8.1: Data masking\n\n8.9: Configuration management\n\n8.10: Information deletion\n\n8.12: Data leakage prevention\n\n8.16: Monitoring activities\n\n8.23: Web filtering\n\n8.28: Secure coding\n\nIn this area, one innovation is particularly important - data leakage\nprevention. However, web filtering is also noteworthy: this control describes\nhow organisations should filter online traffic to prevent users from visiting\npotentially harmful websites.\n\n## 93 Controls in ISO 27001: An overview\n\nHow many ISO 27001 controls are there?\n\nThe full version of ISO 27001:2022 contains 93 controls, which are assigned to\nfour categories: organisational, people, physical and technological. This\nallows responsibilities and areas to be divided according to company division.\n\nTo strengthen your company's information security, it is helpful to have an\noverview of the individual controls. We have provided you with a list of all\n93 controls and their respective areas in the Annex A.\n\nAll 93 ISO 27001:2022 controls in Annex A grouped by controls group:\n\n**Organisational Controls:**\n1.

Right \u2013 a checklist.\n\nISO 27001 serves as the perfect checklist of ISO controls. Organisations are\nnot required to implement all 93 controls but are expected to identify and\napply the most suitable controls for their needs. The process of selecting\napplicable controls begins with risk assessment and treatment. After the\ntreatment of risks, you must measure how successful the controls were in\nachieving information security.\n\nInformation security is all about putting in place a set of strong rules that\nwill mature over time. As a result, implementing the controls outlined in\nAnnex A is and must always be the responsibility of a number of people.\n\nThe process of gathering all required documentation and becoming ISO 27001\ncompliant can be challenging, which is why you and your organisation may\nbenefit from the expertise of an ISO 27001 consultant.\n\n## Benefits of ISO 27001: Why should companies adopt ISO 27001?  \n\nIdentifying and addressing security risks is beneficial to any organisation.\nThe ISO 27001 controls help to clearly categorise potential risks. But what\nare the tangible benefits of mitigating risks?\n\nNot all organisations choose to adopt ISO 27001 certification, but many use it\nas a framework to keep their ISMS safe from the risk of information security\nbreaches.\n\nISO 27001 compliance demonstrates to stakeholders (such as customers and\nshareholders) that an organisation has prioritised the implementation of\ninformation security best practices. This can lead to the following benefits:\n\n  * Improved competitiveness  \n  \n\n  * Reduced risks of fines and losses due to data protection breaches  \n  \n\n  * Improved brand perception  \n  \n\n  * Compliance with relevant business, legal, economic and statutory requirements  \n  \n\n  * Improved structure and focus  \n  \n\n  * Reduced number of required audits  \n  \n\n  * Unbiased assessment of the organisation\u2019s security posture\n\nIn short, ISO 27001 certification makes it easier to satisfy regulatory\nobligations, demonstrates your organisation\u2019s reliability to partners, and\nshows your dedication to maintaining the highest standards of information\nsecurity. It also increases the value of your brand, resulting in a win-win\nsituations.\n\n## Our checklist: How to achieve ISO 27001 compliance  \n\nEven if they are not seeking official certification, there is always the\noption for organisations to pursue compliance with the ISO 27001 standard\nrequirements. The following list shows the best practices you can implement to\nachieve this and can be used very well as a checklist:\n\n  * Talk to your stakeholders to understand their information security expectations.  \n  \n\n  * Define the scope of your ISMS and the information security measures you will implement.  \n  \n\n  * Define a clear security policy.  \n  \n\n  * Conduct a risk assessment to identify any existing and potential risks to your information security.  \n  \n\n  * Implement measures and risk management methods that set clear objectives.  \n  \n\n  * Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your information security practices and conduct risk assessments.\n\nGain practical insights from our work with FR\u00c4NKISCHE, where we guided them\nthrough their internal audit, paving the way for successful external\ncertification.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001-controls-annex-a/", "title": "ISO 27001 Controls: Overview of all measures from Annex A", "description": "ISO 27001 Controls are all 93 measures from Annex A of the new ISO 27001:2022.

This will help\nyou to develop an effective ISMS that protects your information assets.\n  \n## What is covered by Clause 4.1?\n\n3 main areas that organisations need to understand in order to comply with\nClause 4.1\n\n  * Internal factors\n  * External factors\n  * Interested parties\n\nClause 4.1 of ISO 27001 includes understanding the internal and external\nfactors that can impact the security of their information assets.\n\nInternal factors include things like the organisation's:\n\n  * Business operations: How the organisation does business, including its products and services, its customers and suppliers, and its financial situation.  \n  \n\n  * Culture: The values and beliefs that are shared by the organisation's employees.  \n  \n\n  * Governance structure: The way that the organisation is managed, including its decision-making processes and its risk management framework.  \n  \n\n  * Available resources: The people, money, and technology that the organisation has available to protect its information assets.\n\nExternal factors include things like:\n\n  * Economic environment: The state of the economy, including interest rates, inflation, and unemployment.  \n  \n\n  * Political environment: The laws and regulations that govern the organisation's activities, as well as the stability of the political climate.  \n  \n\n  * Social environment: The attitudes and beliefs of the people who are affected by the organisation's activities, including its customers, employees, and suppliers.  \n  \n\n  * Legal and regulatory environment: The laws and regulations that govern the organisation's activities, including those related to information security.  \n  \n\n  * Threat landscape: The current and emerging threats to the organisation's information assets, including cyber threats, physical threats, and social engineering threats.\n\nInterested parties are those who have a stake in the organisation's\ninformation security, such as:\n\n  * Customers: Those who use the organisation's products or services.  \n  \n\n  * Partners: Those who work with the organisation, such as suppliers and distributors.  \n  \n\n  * Regulators: Those who have the authority to enforce laws and regulations, such as government agencies.  \n  \n\n  * Employees: Those who work for the organisation.  \n  \n\n  * Shareholders: Those who own a stake in the organisation. \n\nDocumenting the context is important because it helps the organisation to:\n\n  * Identify the risks and opportunities that it faces.  \n  \n\n  * Develop appropriate controls to mitigate the risks.  \n  \n\n  * Assess the effectiveness of its ISMS.  \n  \n\n  * Make improvements to its ISMS as needed.  \n\nLet's dig a bit deeper into each of these areas.\n\n  * **Internal factors** can have a significant impact on the security of an organisation's information assets. For example, if the organisation has a strong security culture, it is less likely to be affected by security breaches. Conversely, if the organisation has a weak security culture, it is more likely to be affected by security breaches.  \n  \n\n  * **External factors** can also have a significant impact on the security of an organisation's information assets. For example, if there is a new cyber threat that the organisation is not prepared for, it could be affected by a security breach. Conversely, if the organisation is aware of the latest cyber threats and has implemented appropriate controls, it is less likely to be affected by security breaches.\n\nHere are some of the benefits of understanding the organisation and its\ncontext:\n\nIt can help organisations to:\n\n  * Identify and mitigate risks to their information assets.  \n  \n\n  * Comply with applicable laws and regulations.  \n  \n\n  * Improve their efficiency and effectiveness.  \n  \n\n  * Build trust with their customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders.\n\nKeep in mind that ISO 27001 is a risk-based standard. This means that the\nfocus of the standard is on identifying and mitigating risks to the\norganisation's information assets.\n\nOrganisations can use the information they gather about their risks to develop\nand implement appropriate controls to mitigate those risks. Controls can be\ntechnical, procedural, or organisational.\n\nOrganisations should also conduct internal audits, assessments, and management\nreviews on a regular basis to ensure that their ISMS is effective in managing\nrisks. This will help organisations to identify and address any gaps in their\nISMS.\n\n> Overall, Clause 4.1 is an important requirement of ISO 27001.

{"page_content": "\n# ISO 27001 Clause 4.2: Understanding the needs and expectations of interested\nparties\n\nClause 4.2 of ISO 27001 requires organisations to _\"understand the needs and\nexpectations of interested parties\"._ Interested parties are defined as\n_\"persons or organisations that can affect, be affected by, or perceive\nthemselves to be affected by the organisation's activities\"._\n\nBy understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties,\norganisations can develop an ISMS that is more effective and meets the needs\nof all stakeholders.\n\nThe organisation shall determine the following:\n\n  * Interested parties that are relevant to the information security management system  \n  \n\n  * The requirements of these interested parties  \n  \n\n  * Which of these requirements will be addressed through the information security management system  \n  \n\n### Who are interested parties?\n\nThe Interested parties can include:\n\n  * Customers\n  * Employees\n  * Shareholders\n  * Suppliers\n  * Regulators\n  * The public\n\nWhen identifying interested parties, it is important to consider a wide range\nof stakeholders. It is also important to be aware of the different types of\nneeds and expectations that interested parties may have.\n\nFor instance, customers might have requirements about how their data is kept\nconfidential, secure, and accessible. Employees could be concerned about\nsafeguarding their personal information. Shareholders might focus on the\norganisation's financial stability.\n\n\n### How to identify interested parties?\n\nThere are several ways to identify interested parties. Some common methods\ninclude:\n\nReviewing the organisation's risk assessment: The risk assessment should\nidentify the organisation's information assets and the threats and\nvulnerabilities that these assets face. The risk assessment can also help to\nidentify the interested parties who are most likely to be affected by a\nsecurity incident.\n\nConsulting with management: Management is often in the best position to\nidentify the organisation's interested parties. They can also provide insights\ninto the needs and expectations of these parties.\n\nConducting surveys and interviews: Surveys and interviews can be used to\ngather information from interested parties about their needs and expectations.\n\nHolding focus groups: Focus groups allow a collection of interested parties to\nshare their needs and expectations in a group setting.\n\n### How to assess the needs and expectations of interested parties\n\nIn pursuing ISO 27001 certification, comprehensively assessing the needs and\nexpectations of interested parties becomes pivotal. This strategic process can\nbe accomplished through a range of effective techniques, including:\n\nQualitative methods: Qualitative methods involve gathering open-ended\ninformation from interested parties.\n\nQuantitative methods: Quantitative methods involve gathering numerical data\nfrom interested parties.  \n\n### How to address the needs and expectations of interested parties\n\nThe needs and expectations of interested parties should be taken into account\nwhen developing and implementing the ISMS. This will help to ensure that the\nISMS is effective and meets the needs of all stakeholders.\n\nThere are a number of ways to address the needs and expectations of interested\nparties. Some common methods include:\n\nCommunicating with interested parties: The organisation should communicate\nwith interested parties about its ISMS. This communication should be clear,\nconcise, and transparent.\n\nInvolving interested parties in the development and implementation of the\nISMS: Interested parties should be involved in the development and\nimplementation of the ISMS. This will help to ensure that the ISMS meets their\nneeds and expectations.\n\nResponding to the needs and expectations of interested parties: The\norganisation should be responsive to the needs and expectations of interested\nparties. This means being willing to make changes to the ISMS as needed.\n\n\n\n### How to review the needs and expectations of interested parties\n\nThe needs and expectations of interested parties should be reviewed on a\nregular basis. This is important because the needs and expectations of\ninterested parties can change over time.  \n  \nThe review process should identify any changes in the needs and expectations\nof interested parties.  \n  \nThe organisation should then make any necessary changes to the ISMS to ensure\nthat it remains effective before logging the change.  \n  \nIf a review is conducted but there has been found to be no change required, it\nis still important to log that a review took place and to state what was done\nas part of the review.\n\n\n\n### How to pass an audit of ISO 27001:2022 Clause 4.2\n\nTo pass an audit of ISO 27001:2022 Clause 4.2, follow these steps below:\n\n  1. Understand the requirements of Clause 4.2  \n  \n\n  2. Identify your interested parties.  \n  \n\n  3. Assess the needs and expectations of your interested parties.  \n  \n\n  4. Address the needs and expectations of your interested parties in your ISMS.  \n  \n\n  5. Document your understanding of the needs and expectations of your interested parties.  \n  \n\n  6. Keep your documentation up to date.  \n  \n\n  7. Be prepared to demonstrate your compliance with Clause 4.2 to auditors.\n\n#### Here are some additional tips:\n\n  * As is crucial throughout the entire ISMS creation/maintenance journey, get buy-in from senior management. The success of your ISMS depends on the support of senior management. Make sure that they understand the importance of Clause 4.2 and are committed to meeting its requirements.  \n  \n\n  * Involve interested parties in the development and implementation of your ISMS. This will help to ensure that their needs and expectations are met. They will appreciate the transparency, and this can help build trust.  \n  \n\n  * Always conduct regular reviews of your ISMS to ensure that it remains effective in meeting the needs and expectations of interested parties.\n\nBy following these tips, you can increase your chances of success in\nimplementing and maintaining an ISMS that meets the requirements of ISO\n27001:2022.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/clause-4-2-needs-and-expectations-of-key-parties/", "title": "ISO 27001 Clause 4.2 Understanding needs & expectations of key parties", "description": "Learn ISO 27001:2022 Clause 4.2 - grasp significance, identify parties, assess needs, and address in your ISMS effectively.", "language": "en-gb"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n# ISO 27001 Clause 4.3: Determining the scope of the ISMS\n\n## What is ISO 27001:2022 Clause 4.3?\n\nClause 4.3 of the ISO 27001 standard is titled \"Determination of the Scope of\nthe ISMS\". It requires organisations to define the scope of their Information\nSecurity Management System (ISMS). The scope of the ISMS defines which\ninformation assets and activities are covered by the system.\n\nThe organisation shall determine the boundaries and applicability of the\ninformation security management system to establish its scope.\n\nWhen determining this scope, the organisation shall consider:\n\n  * The external and internal issues referred to in ISO 27001:2022 Clause 4.1 Understanding the Organisation and Its Context  \n  \n\n  * The requirements referred to in ISO 27001:2022 Clause 4.2 Understanding the Needs and Expectations of Interested Parties  \n  \n\n  * Interfaces and dependencies between activities performed by the organisation, and those that are performed by other organisations.\n\nThe ISMS scope should be determined based on the following factors:\n\n  * **The organisation's risk appetite:** The organisation's risk appetite is the amount of risk that the organisation is willing to accept. The scope of the ISMS should be aligned with it.  \n  \n\n  * **The organisation's business needs:** The scope of the ISMS should cover the information assets and activities that are critical to the organisation's business.  \n  \n\n  * **The organisation's legal and regulatory requirements:** The scope of the ISMS should include the information assets and activities that are subject to legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOnce the scope of the ISMS has been determined, it should be documented in the\nfollowing locations:\n\n  * Your statement of applicability (SoA). The SoA should be kept up-to-date as the organisation changes. This explains what specific controls you are looking to implement as per the scope \u2013 document is an ever-changing document that evolves in the creation of the ISMS.  \n  \n\n  * A scope policy that goes into specific detail as to what will be included in the scope from a business perspective, this includes the following areas:  \n\n\n    * Activities\n    * Products\n    * Services\n    * Interfaces\n    * Boundaries (both digital and physical)  \n  \n\n  * In addition to this, you will also want to state if there are any exclusions which can be stated in both the SoA and the scope policy. \n\n## Why is it important to determine the scope of your ISMS?\n\nDefining the scope of your Information Security Management System (ISMS) is of\nparamount importance, as it establishes the extent to which the standard\napplies.\n\nNot all information assets and activities are covered by this standard. By\ndefining your ISMS scope, you ensure that the system is only implemented for\nthe information assets and activities that are important to your organisation.\n\nFurthermore, the scope should be aligned with your organisation's risk\nappetite, also known as your risk tolerance. This reflects the level of risk\nthat your organisation is comfortable with.\n\nBy aligning your ISMS scope with your risk appetite, you guarantee that the\nsystem effectively manages the risks associated with your valuable information\nassets.\n\n## How to set up the ISMS scope\n\nHere are the key steps involved in crafting an effective ISMS scope to meet\nISO 27001:\n\nLay the groundwork. Before you can start mapping out your scope, make sure you\nhave done the work for Clause 4.1 and Clause 4.2, 4.3 requires quite a bit of\ndecision-making from top management, so make sure they are heavily involved\nfrom the start.\n\nMap the scope. Once you understand your risk appetite and tolerance, you can\nstart to map out the scope of your ISMS. This means identifying the\ninformation assets and activities that you need to protect.\n\nConsider your stakeholders. Your stakeholders are the people who have a high\ninterest in your organisation's information security. These stakeholders may\ninclude customers, employees, partners, and regulators. You need to consider\ntheir needs and expectations when mapping out your scope \u2013 this ties into the\nlist of interested parties as per Clause 4.2.\n\nFocus on the essentials. Not all information assets and activities are created\nequal. Some are more important than others. When mapping out your scope, focus\non the essential assets and activities that need to be protected.\n\nBe realistic. It's important to be realistic when mapping out your scope. You\nneed to be able to implement and maintain the controls that you put in place.\n\nReview and update regularly. Your organisation's information security\nlandscape is constantly changing. As a result, you need to review and update\nyour ISMS scope regularly.\n\n\n\n#### Some of the things to keep in mind when defining the scope of your ISMS:\n\nThe scope should be:\n\n  * Comprehensive enough to cover all of your organisation's important information assets and activities.  \n  \n\n  * Specific enough to avoid ambiguity.  \n  \n\n  * Flexible enough to allow for changes to your organisation's business \n\n## 3 tips for determining the scope of your ISMS\n\n  * Involve key stakeholders in the process. The scope of your ISMS should be aligned with the needs of your organisation. By involving key stakeholders in the process, you can ensure that the scope is appropriate for your organisation.  \n  \n\n  * Consider your organisation's risk appetite. As mentioned earlier, the scope of your ISMS should be aligned with your organization's risk appetite. This means considering the amount of risk that your organisation is willing to accept.  \n  \n\n  * Be flexible. The scope of your ISMS may need to change over time. As your organisation changes, you may need to adjust the scope of your ISMS to ensure that it is still effective. \n\n## The benefits of defining the scope of your ISMS:\n\n  * It ensures that the ISMS is effective in protecting your organisation's information assets.  \n  \n\n  * It helps to identify the information assets and activities that are most important to your organisation.  \n  \n\n  * It helps to prioritise the resources that are needed to protect your organisation's information assets.  \n  \n\n  * It helps to communicate to stakeholders what is included in the ISMS.  \n  \n\n### Conclusion\n\nDetermining the scope of your ISO 27001 ISMS is an important and mandatory\nstep in implementing the standard.

{"page_content": "\nA complete guide to ISO/IEC 27001:2022\nTo keep pace with this digital transformation, both the ISO 27001 Information Security Management and ISO 27002 Controls for Information Security standards have been revamped. These revisions introduce sturdier controls, empowering your organisation to tackle the escalating complexity of security risks, maintain operational consistency, and achieve a competitive edge. The new version\u2019s complete title is ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection.\n\nPromptly assimilating these amendments and their ramifications on your organisation will not only safeguard your information but also enhance and uphold your competitive stance.\n\nWhat is ISO/IEC 27001:2022?\nISO/IEC 27001:2022 is the updated version of ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or just plain old ISO 27001.\n\nISO 27001 is one of the most recognised global standards for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), outlining the essential requirements for an ISMS. It\u2019s a universal guide for organisations of any size and from all industries to establish, implement, sustain and consistently enhance an information security management system.\n\nAdherence to ISO 27001 shows that an organisation or business has instituted a robust system to manage the risks associated with the security of its data, whether owned or managed, aligning with the best practices and principles codified in this International Standard.\n\nOn 25th October 2022, the final version of ISO/IEC 27001: 2022 was published. The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) agreed and set out its mandatory requirements to enable the swift and timely transition to the new version of the standard. \n\nSo what\u2019s the difference between ISO 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27001:2022? The latter includes a variety of updates to reflect the ever-changing digital landscape.\n\nWhy is ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Important?\nISO/IEC 27001:2022 is especially important today with our ever-changing digital environment. Implementation of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 has the following benefits:\n\nEnsure Adherence to the Latest Standard\nThe ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard remains the most recent and all-encompassing framework for an ISMS. A Lead Implementer for ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is equipped to guarantee that the organisation remains in line with the current prerequisites of the standard.\n\nStreamlined Implementation\nThe deployment of an ISMS can be a complicated endeavour, but a Lead Implementer for ISO/IEC 27001:2022 possesses the insight and proficiency to make the process as streamlined as possible. They can assist in pinpointing deficiencies in the organisation\u2019s existing security initiatives and provide counsel on the integration of new controls.\n\nRisk Management\nAn ISMS, grounded in the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard, is formulated to detect, evaluate, and manage information security risks. The Lead Implementer can aid the organisation in uncovering potential risks and formulating strategies to lessen them.\n\nEnhance Reputation\nThe deployment of an ISMS, based on the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard, can bolster the organisation\u2019s standing and instil customers with the confidence that their information is safe. Your Lead Implementer can affirm that the system is efficacious and satisfies the expectations of the organisation\u2019s stakeholders.\n\nWhat are the main changes in ISO/IEC 27001 2022?\n35 controls remain unchanged, 57 have been merged, 23 others have been renamed and 11 new ones have been introduced.

While not previously specified in ISO 27001:2013, this requirement now ensures that progress (or lack thereof) against objectives is tracked.\n\nClause 6.3 \u201cPlanning of Changes\u201d\nAn entirely new clause that encapsulates the prior requirements of Change Control, it\u2019s titled \u201cPlanning of Changes.\u201d It ensures that any changes to the information security management system required by the organisation are executed in an orderly fashion.\n\nClause 7.4 \u201cCommunication\u201d\nA further modification has led to the removal of item (e), the requirement for establishing communication processes, suggesting that the method of communication delivery doesn\u2019t significantly impact its reception.\n\nClause 8.1 \u201cOperational planning and control\u201d\nThis now states \u201cThe organisation shall ensure that externally provided process, products or services that are relevant to the ISMS are controlled.\u201d The revised wording of this control offers clearer guidance for implementing an ISMS compared to the original phrasing. Also, the requirement to implement plans for achieving objectives was removed, as it\u2019s covered in Clause 6.2.\n\nClause 9.1 \u201cMonitoring, measurement analysis and evaluation\u201d\nTransferring the note from the existing standard stating \u201cThe methods selected should produce comparable and reproducible results to be considered valid\u201d to the main body of the text lends crucial clarity about what qualifies as a \u201cvalid\u201d result according to the standard.\n\nClause 9.3 \u201cManagement Review\u201d\nThe reorganisation of this clause has resulted in three sub-clauses.

{"page_content": "\n## ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 27002:2022: What Were The Updates & How to Comply\n\nIn 2022, ISO 27001 was updated along with its companion guidance standard ISO\n27002. Starting April 2024, organizations pursuing ISO 27001 for the first\ntime must be certified on the 2022 version. Organizations who are already\ncertified must transition to this latest version by October 31, 2025.\n\nTo ensure a smooth compliance journey or transition period, you must\nunderstand the changes to ISO 27001 requirements and the Annex A controls in\nISO 27002. We\u2019ll cover these major updates below.\n\n## What changed with ISO 27001:2022?\n\nBelow are the key changes found in the latest version of ISO 27001.\n\n### Editorial updates in ISMS Clauses 4-10\n\nOverall, the updates in the ISMS Clauses 4-10 include minor wording and\nstructural changes.\n\nFor example, changes to Clause 6: Planning remove ambiguity and outdated\nlanguage (i.e., control objectives). Clause 4.4, an existing requirement to\nestablish, implement, maintain, and continually improve your ISMS, now\nincludes the phrase \u201cincluding the processes needed and their interactions.\u201d\n\nIn terms of structural changes, Clause 9.2: Internal audit was split into\n9.2.1: General and 9.2.2: Internal audit programme. However, the requirements\nremain the same.\n\nSimilarly, Clause 9.3: Management review was split into three subsections \u2014\n9.3.1: General, 9.3.2: Management review inputs, and 9.3.3: Management review\nresults.\n\n### Introduced Clause 6.3\n\nThe 2022 version also introduced a new subclause. Clause 6.3: Planning for\nChanges requires that any change to the ISMS be carried out in a planned\nmanner. The goal of this subclause is to ensure organizations consider the\npurpose of any change to their ISMS, potential consequences, impact on the\nISMS, resource availability, and allocation or reallocation of\nresponsibilities and authorities, among other factors.\n\n### Updated Annex A controls\n\nThe major change in ISO 27001:2022 that organizations need to be aware of is\nthe official update to Annex A controls. This will be discussed in the section\nbelow.\n\n## What changed with ISO 27002:2022?\n\nBelow are the key changes found in the latest version of ISO 27002.\n\n### Reduced number of controls\n\nThe major change to ISO 27002 (and therefore ISO 27001) is that the total\nnumber of Annex A controls was reduced from 114 to 93. However, none of the\nprevious controls were removed. 57 were simply merged into 24 controls. 11\ncontrols were added. 1 was split. The remaining 58 controls are mostly\nunchanged, with minor contextual updates.\n\n### 11 new controls\n\nSome controls are brand new in the 2022 version, meaning they are not found in\nISO/IEC 27001:2013.\n\nThe 11 new controls added to Annex A include:\n\n**A.5.7** | Threat intelligence  \n**A.5.23** | Information security for use of cloud services  \n**A.5.30** | ICT readiness for business continuity  \n**A.7.4** | Physical security monitoring  \n**A.8.9** | Configuration management  \n**A.8.10** | Information deletion  \n**A.8.11** | Data masking  \n**A.8.12** | Data leakage prevention  \n**A.8.16** |  Monitoring activities  \n**A.8.23** | Web filtering  \n**A.8.28** | Secure coding  \n  \n### Reduced Annex A control domains\n\nIn the previous version, Annex A controls were divided into 14 domains. In the\n2022 version, these were consolidated and reorganized into 4 clauses referred\nto as themes. These are:\n\n  * Clause 5: Organizational Controls (37 controls)\n  * Clause 6: People Controls (8 controls)\n  * Clause 7: Physical Controls (14 controls)\n  * Clause 8: Technological Controls (34 controls)\n\n### Introduced attributes\n\nISO 27002 introduced a simpler taxonomy for ISO 27001 controls. However, the\nfour categories mentioned above are such broad descriptors that it can be\nchallenging to know how you are using the controls in each category and if you\nneed to implement every one.\n\nTo address this challenge, ISO 27002:2022 also introduced associated\nattributes. These offer different lenses to view controls so that you\u2019re able\nto better understand which you need to implement and how you\u2019re using them\nthroughout your risk assessment and treatment process.\n\nISO 27002:2022 defines the following five attributes that are meant to be\ngeneric enough to be used by any organization. These attributes are also\ncustomizable so you can use your own.\n\n#### 1\\. Control types\n\nWhen and how does the control impact the risk outcome during an information\nsecurity incident?\n\nPossible attribute values are\n\n  * Preventive: control acts before a threat occurs\n  * Detective: control acts when a threat occurs\n  * Corrective: control acts after a threat occurs\n\n#### 2\\. Information security properties\n\nWhich characteristic of information will the control help preserve?\n\nPossible attribute values are:\n\n  * Confidentiality\n  * Integrity\n  * Availability\n\n#### 3\\. Cybersecurity properties\n\nWhat cybersecurity concept defined in the framework described in ISO/IEC TS\n27110 is associated with the control?\n\nPossible attribute values are:\n\n  * Identify\n  * Protect\n  * Detect\n  * Respond\n  * Recover\n\n#### 4\\. Operational capabilities\n\nWhat operational capabilities is the control associated with? Or, which\ndepartment should be assigned this control or risk?\n\nPossible attribute values include but are not limited to:\n\n  * Application security\n  * Asset management\n  * Governance\n  * Information protection\n  * Human resource security\n  * Identity and access management\n  * Information security event management \n  * Physical security\n  * Secure configuration\n\n#### 5\\. Security domains\n\nWhat security field, expertise, service, and/or product is the control\nassociated with?\n\nPossible attribute values are:\n\n  * Governance and ecosystem\n  * Protection\n  * Defence\n  * Resilience\n\n## What do these changes mean for organizations that are already ISO 27001\ncertified?\n\nOrganizations that are currently certified to ISO 27001:2013 will have three\nyears to transition to ISO/IEC 27001:2022. The transition period starts on\nOctober 31, 2022 and ends on October 31, 2025. Certifications based on ISO\n27001:2013 will expire or be withdrawn at the end of the transition period.\n\nTransition audits can either be done at the same time as the next audit (e.g.,\nRecertification audit and transition audit), or separately.\n\n## What do these changes mean for organizations that are pursuing ISO 27001\ncertification for the first time?\n\nOrganizations pursuing ISO 27001 for the first time (both Stage 1 and Stage 2\naudits) can still be certified on the 27001:2013 version until April 2024.\nTransition audits can either be done at the same time as your next audit\n(e.g., surveillance audit and transition audit), or separately.\n\n## FAQs\n\nHow many controls are in ISO 27001:2022?\n\nThere are 93 controls in ISO 27001:2022. These are outlined in a section\ncalled Annex A. ISO 27002:2022 expands on this Annex A overview.\n\nWhen did ISO publish changes to ISO 27001 and ISO 27002?\n\nISO published changes to ISO 27001 in October 2022 and ISO 27002 back in\nFebruary 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s the official title of ISO 27001:2022?\n\nThis official title is ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security, Cybersecurity,\nand Privacy Protection.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ISO 27001 and ISO 27002?\n\nISO 27001 is an internationally-respected information security framework. It\noutlines the requirements to establish, maintain, and continually improve an\ninformation security management system (ISMS). Organizations can pursue ISO\n27001 certification by completing an external audit by an accredited ISO audit\nfirm.\n\nOn the other hand, ISO 27002 isn\u2019t a standard that you can be certified on \u2014\nit\u2019s a companion to ISO 27001 that provides guidance and explains the purpose,\ndesign, and implementation of each control in greater detail.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://secureframe.com/blog/iso-27001-2022", "title": "ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 27002:2022: What Were The Updates & How to Comply", "description": "This article explains the changes made to ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 27002:2022 and what they mean for your compliance posture.\u00a0", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "\n\n# How to Transition to ISO 27001:2022\n\n## ISO 27001:2022: The new standard for information security\n\nISO 27001 is the international standard for information security management\nsystems (ISMS). It provides organisations with a framework for managing their\ninformation security risks and protecting sensitive data.\n\nThe latest version of ISO 27001, published in 2022, includes several\nsignificant changes. These changes are designed to make the standard more\nrelevant to the current threat landscape and to help organisations improve\ntheir information security posture.\n\n\n## Why is it important to transition to ISO 27001:2022?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why it is important for organisations to\ntransition to ISO 27001:2022. These include:\n\n  * To comply with the latest international standards for information security.  \n  \n\n  * To protect sensitive data from cyber threats.  \n  \n\n  * To demonstrate to customers, partners, and other stakeholders that the organisation is committed to information security.  \n  \n\n  * To improve the organisation's overall risk management processes.  \n  \n\n  * To reduce the risk of data breaches and other incidents.  \n  \n\n  * To improve the organisation's efficiency and effectiveness.  \n  \n\n  * To further improve the maturity of CIA ( **Confidentiality, Integrity** and **Availability** of data).\n\n\n## ISO 27001:2022 transition timeline\n\nThe transition period for ISO 27001:2022 began on October 31, 2022, and will\nend on October 31, 2025.\n\nDuring this time, organisations that are already certified to ISO 27001:2013\nhave three years to transition to the new standard.\n\nOrganisations that have not yet started their ISO 27001 certification journey\nhave until April 1, 2024, to become certified to the new standard.\n\nHere is a detailed timeline of the transition period:\n\n  * October 31, 2022: The transition period begins.  \n  \n\n  * May 1, 2024: All initial (new) certifications should be to the ISO 27001:2022 edition.  \n  \n\n  * July 31, 2025: All transition audits should be conducted by this date.  \n  \n\n  * October 31, 2025: The transition period ends. Certificates for ISO/IEC 27001:2013 will no longer be valid after this date.\n\nOrganisations that are already certified to ISO 27001:2013:\n\n  * Can continue to operate under their existing certification until October 31, 2025.  \n  \n\n  * Must transition to ISO 27001:2022 by this date (October 2025).  \n  \n\n  * Can choose to transition at any time during the transition period.  \n  \n\n  * May need to undergo a transition audit to verify their compliance with the new standard.\n\nOrganisations that are already certified will have until the 31st of October\n2025 as the deadline to transition. As of that date, all certifications for\nISO 27001:2013 will expire and will no longer be considered valid.\n\nIn the meantime, organisations should continue to manage and improve their\nexisting 27001:2013 ISMS in conjunction with planning a transition audit. If\nyour company is not certified yet but still wants to certify against the 2013\nrevision, you can do so up to the 31st of October, 2024.\n\nBut generally speaking, the sooner you comply with ISO 27001:2022 \u2014 the\nbetter. It will save you time, money and frustration.\n\n\nOrganisations that have not yet started their ISO 27001 certification journey:\n\n  * Must become certified to ISO 27001:2022 by April 1, 2024.  \n  \n\n  * Can choose to become certified to ISO 27001:2013, but this will not give them any additional time to transition to the new standard.  \n  \n\n  * It is important to note that the transition period is not a grace period. Organisations that do not transition to ISO 27001:2022 by October 31, 2025, will no longer be compliant with the standard, and their certificates will be invalid.\n\nHere are some additional things to keep in mind about the transition timeline:\n\n  * The transition period is designed to give organisations enough time to implement the changes required by ISO 27001:2022.  \n  \n\n  * However, organisations may need to start the transition process sooner if they have a significant amount of work to do.  \n  \n\n  * The transition process can be complex and challenging, so it is important to start planning early.  \n  \n\n  * There are a number of resources available to help organisations with the transition process, such as ISO's own guidance document.\n\n\n## What are the key changes in ISO 27001:2022?\n\nThe new edition of ISO 27001 introduces several significant changes,\nincluding:\n\nA focus on risk-based thinking: The new standard emphasizes the importance of\norganisations understanding their information security risks and taking steps\nto mitigate those risks. This is a major change from the previous version,\nwhich focused on a more prescriptive approach to information security.\n\nA greater emphasis on the importance of people and culture: The new standard\nrecognizes that people are a critical element of any information security\nprogram. It emphasizes the importance of creating a culture of information\nsecurity within the organisation. This includes things like training employees\non information security best practices and promoting a security-minded mindset\nthroughout the organisation.\n\nThe introduction of new controls to address emerging threats: The new standard\nincludes a number of new controls to address emerging threats, such as cloud\ncomputing, social engineering, and data breaches. These new controls are\ndesigned to help organisations stay ahead of the curve and protect their\ninformation assets from the latest threats.\n\nA new way of breaking down the standard: The new standard changes the layout\nof the Annex A controls to be broken down into smaller groups. These controls\nnow evolve around what they most protect and thus simplifying what was once a\nmore complicated breakdown.\n\n\n## What has changed in ISO 27001:2022?\n\nHere are some of the specific changes in each clause of the standard:\n\nContext and Scope: The scope clause now applies to \"relevant\" requirements of\ninterested parties and processes. This means that organisations need to\nconsider the needs of all of their stakeholders, not just their customers and\nsuppliers.\n\nPlanning: The planning clause now requires organisations to define their\ninformation security objectives and to monitor and review those objectives on\na regular basis. This is a change from the previous version, which only\nrequired organisations to define their information security policies.\n\nSupport: The support clause now requires organisations to define how they will\ncommunicate information security risks and issues to their staff. This is a\nnew requirement in the new standard.\n\nOperation: The operation clause now requires organisations to control\n\"externally provided processes, products, or services\" that are relevant to\ntheir ISMS. This is a change from the previous version, which only required\norganisations to control their own processes and systems.\n\n## The new structure of Annex A controls in ISO 27001:2022\n\nThe new edition of ISO 27001 restructures the Annex A controls into four\ncategories: organisational, people, physical, and technological. This is a\nsignificant improvement over the previous version, which had 14 control\ndomains. The new structure is designed to make it easier for organisations to\nselect and implement the controls that are most relevant to their needs.\n\n  * The organisational category contains 37 controls that address the overall management of information security within an organisation. These controls include things like establishing an information security policy, appointing a security manager, and conducting risk assessments.  \n  \n\n  * The people category contains 8 controls that address the role of people in information security. These controls include things like training employees on information security best practices, conducting background checks on new hires, and managing user access to sensitive information.  \n  \n\n  * The physical category contains 14 controls that address the physical security of information assets. These controls include things like securing buildings and facilities, protecting computer rooms, and managing the disposal of sensitive information.  \n  \n\n  * The technological category contains 34 controls that address the technological aspects of information security. These controls include things like implementing firewalls and antivirus software, encrypting data, and managing access to information systems.\n\nThe new structure of Annex A controls is aligned with the four pillars of\ninformation security:\n\n  * Organisational: This pillar addresses the need for a strong organisational commitment to information security.  \n  \n\n  * People: This pillar addresses the importance of people in information security.  \n  \n\n  * Physical: This pillar addresses the need to protect information assets from physical threats.  \n  \n\n  * Technological: This pillar addresses the need to protect information assets from technological threats.\n\nThe new structure of Annex A controls is a significant improvement over the\nprevious version. It makes it easier for organisations to implement an\neffective information security management system and protect their information\nassets from a wide range of threats.\n\nIn addition to the new structure, ISO 27001:2022 also includes 11 new\ncontrols. These controls are designed to address emerging threats, such as\ncloud computing, social engineering, and data breaches. The new controls are\nalso designed to improve the effectiveness of information security management\nsystems by providing organisations with more options for mitigating risks.\n\nThe new controls are as follows:\n\nThreat intelligence: This involves the collection and analysis of information\nabout potential threats to information security within organisations.\n\nInformation security for the use of cloud services: Assessing and managing the\nrisks associated with the use of cloud services.\n\nICT readiness for business continuity: Ensuring that information and\ncommunications technology (ICT) systems remain resilient and operational in\ndisaster scenarios is a requirement.\n\nPhysical security monitoring: Continually monitoring the physical security\nsystems to promptly identify and respond to security incidents.\n\nConfiguration management: Managing the configuration of their information\nsystems to ensure that they are secure.\n\nInformation deletion: Securely deleting sensitive information when it is no\nlonger needed.\n\nData masking: Masking sensitive information to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nData leakage prevention: Preventing sensitive information from being leaked\noutside of the organisation.\n\nMonitoring activities: Monitoring the information security activities to\nensure that they are effective.\n\nWeb filtering: Filtering web traffic to prevent access to malicious websites.\n\nSecure coding: Developing and using secure code to protect the information\nsystems.\n\nThrough these new Annex A controls, many organisations may be required to\nimplement 20+ new ISMS documents, policies and procedures into their ISMS\nbased on their scope and requirements.\n\n## Your roadmap to transition to ISO 27001:2022\n\nThe transition to ISO 27001:2022 can be a daunting task, but it is important\nto remember that it is a journey, not a destination. By following a structured\nroadmap, you can make the transition smoother and more successful.\n\nHere are the key steps in your roadmap to transition:\n\nRaise awareness: The first step is to raise awareness of the transition within\nyour organisation. This includes communicating the benefits of the new\nstandard, as well as the timeline and requirements for the transition.\n\nConduct a change analysis and gap assessment: Once you have raised awareness,\nyou need to conduct a change analysis and gap assessment. This will help you\nto identify the areas where your current information security management\nsystem (ISMS) needs to be updated to meet the requirements of ISO 27001:2022.\n\nReview and update documentation: Once you have identified the gaps, you need\nto review and update your ISMS documentation. This includes your policies,\nprocedures, and work instructions.\n\nPerform an internal audit: Once your documentation is updated, you need to\nperform an internal audit to ensure that your ISMS is compliant with the new\nstandard.\n\nConduct a transition gap assessment: After the internal audit, you need to\nconduct a transition gap assessment. This will help you to identify any\nremaining gaps that need to be addressed before you can transition to ISO\n27001:2022.\n\nUndergo a transition audit: Once you have addressed all of the gaps, you need\nto undergo a transition audit. This is a final check to ensure that your ISMS\nis compliant with the new standard.\n\nMaintain continuous improvement: Once you have transitioned to ISO 27001:2022,\nit is important to maintain continuous improvement. This means regularly\nreviewing your ISMS to ensure that it is still effective in protecting your\ninformation assets.\n\nIn addition to these key steps, there are a few other things you can do to\nmake the transition to ISO 27001:2022 smoother and more successful. These\ninclude (and are not limited to):\n\n  * Get buy-in from senior management.  \n  \n\n  * Involve all stakeholders in the transition process.  \n  \n\n  * Use a certified transition partner.  \n  \n\n  * Set realistic goals and milestones.  \n  \n\n  * Communicate regularly with stakeholders.  \n  \n\n  * By following these tips, you can make the transition to ISO 27001:2022 a success.\n\nHere are some additional proactive business advice:\n\n  * Use the transition as an opportunity to improve your overall information security posture.  \n  \n\n  * Consider using the transition as a way to consolidate or streamline your ISMS processes.  \n  \n\n  * Use the transition to communicate the importance of information security to your employees and other stakeholders.  \n  \n\n  * Use the transition to improve your organisation's risk management capabilities.\n\nBy taking a proactive approach to the transition, you can make it a valuable\nasset to your organisation.\n\n\nWhat is next for ISO 27001?\n\nAs is typical with ISO standards in general, they are all subject to updates\nover time, and ISO 27001:2022 will be no different.\n\nAs cybersecurity threats continue to grow \u2014 we can expect the standard to be\nreviewed more and more frequently.\n\nOn another note, with more focus on information security for the use of cloud\nservices, we can expect top cloud providers such as AWS, GCP and Microsoft\nAzure to start cloud-offering out-of-the-box compliance solutions to support\nwith the new ISO 27001:2022 through things like cloud configuration checks and\ndata leakage prevention solutions.\n", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-risk-treatment-plan-what-you-need-to-know", "title": "ISO 27001 risk treatment plan: How to develop the right one", "description": "Do you need help with an ISO 27001 risk treatment plan for your business?

{"page_content": "# How Much Does It Cost to Implement ISO 27001?\n\nA budget provides a financial roadmap essential for making wise decisions over\na defined period. ISO certifications can provide ROI and scaling opportunities\nfor organisations that invest properly. The cost of ISO 27001 certifications\ncan seem high when looking at the top-level figures, but that is quickly\nrecouped for diligent businesses.\n\nThis is because ISO 27001 is required to protect ISMS and ensure that data is\nnever exposed to malicious activity. With 37% of large organisations having\nexperienced a cyber security breach in the past 12 months, the rationale for\nbeing ISO certified speaks for itself. However, we understand that the\nfinancial side of things requires clarification for many who want to be\nmindful of budgets without cutting corners.\n\nKeep on reading this blog to find out how much the implementation of ISO 27001\nwill cost in 2023.\n\n## What Factors Affect The Cost of ISO 27001 Implementation?\n\nImplementing ISO 27001 requires alignment of a company's ISMS with the\ncontrols outlined by ISO 27001. This means the process, and in-turn associate\ncosts, will differ between businesses.\n\nThe factors that affect the cost of configuring an ISMS to be ISO compliant\nare as follows:\n\n  * Size of the business - The number of employees, scale of operations, and operating regions will all impact what the ISMS is exposed to.\n  * Maturity of the company - The difference between having already established processes and starting from scratch can cost money as there will be different requirements for both. Older businesses can also bring their own issues as changing systems ingrained in history require additional work.\n  * Access to knowledge - The right people to work on the ISO implementation is essential for its success. Whether this is an in-house expert or an agency, such as our own, you must have the know-how to stop costs from spiralling.\n  * Available time - The time you have carved out for the implementation project will also affect the costs. It is best to hit the task with a structured timeline and dedicated time to ensure it can run smoothly.\n\nNo matter the factors that affect a business, this compliance standard can be\nimplemented by anyone, which is one of the benefits. With advantages including\nbeing searchable online if you are ISO 27001 certified, improved brand image\nand ROI opportunities, we think you will agree it is worth investing in if you\ncan afford to do so.\n\n## What Costs Go Into ISO 27001 Implementation?\n\nIf you have read our article about what ISO 27001 is, you will know it can\ntake up to a year for some companies to achieve ISO certification. Below, we\nhave broken down what costs you will need to plan for the implementation\nphases of the application, as planning your spend throughout this long period\nis essential for organisations.\n\nThe costs included below will differ depending on the resources you choose to\nuse, such as existing team members of outsourcing support, but the prices are\nall relevant to the investment that a business is making.\n\n### Getting Ready Costs\n\nThe first step of how to get ISO certification includes preparing, which does\nhave some financial aspects attached to it. As you understand, when\nconsidering the number of requirements that ISO 27001 has, investment should\nbe made to improve the chances of success.\n\nYou can expect to spend anywhere from \u00a35,000 to \u00a330,000, depending on the size\nof the organisation for this phase. This includes the following:\n\n  * Gap analysis conduction and report deciphering\n  * Policy planning\n  * Risk management planning\n  * Internal audits in relation to ISO controls\n  * Consulting fees and reporting\n\n### Implementation of Processes\n\nNext is spending on the processes and training that will embed ISO 27001 into\nyour company's ISMS. The points included in this section demonstrate how Cyber\nEssentials is not the same as ISO 27001 as the implementation requires a much\ndeeper level of planning with ISO standards as more control measures must be\nconsidered.\n\nOne of the considerations for ISO 27001 is people. This means that training\ncosts should be considered to ensure every stakeholder can work whilst being\nISO compliant. This can range from around \u00a3500 to \u00a31000 annually but will be\nhigher for larger organisations or a more segmented approach.\n\nThe cost of ongoing management needs to be considered during the\nimplementation phase as the start of either an employee contract or third-\nparty agreement will need to commence. This cost is hard to define, but we can\nconfirm that an ISO auditor's average salary is \u00a345,888, which provides an\nindication.\n\nProfessional support should also be chosen to implement the ISMS\ninfrastructure, even if ongoing help is not planned. Having a solid foundation\nto build upon is essential for ISO, so this quickly pays for itself. Depending\non company size and maturity, this can cost anything from \u00a31000 to \u00a310,000\nagain.\n\n### Audit Fees\n\nAudit fees are also an implementation cost, as without considering them,\ncompliance cannot be achieved. We consider every stage of the process to\nachieve ISO to be considered implementation. Auditing is also essential to\nbudget for as it is one way to stop ISO from becoming outdated. This is\nbecause it requires an assessment of the latest risks and trends at every\nstage.\n\nThe cost of an ISO certification audit depends on the company's size. The\nestimated fees range from \u00a36,250 for one employee to \u00a333,750 for 6800 people.\n\nFactors such as the length of audit time and the amount of information\navailable will impact this, which is why it's always best to be prepared.\nThese prices will remain standard across the industry, but it is always worth\ngaining quotes from a few external auditors to ensure you get the best value.\nThis cost also covers stage one and stage two, which need to be passed before\ncertification is awarded.\n\n## What Costs Need To Be Considered Once ISO 27001 Is Obtained?\n\nBeing awarded ISO 27001 status after a successful implementation is just the\nstart of the work, as companies must then undergo continual audits to ensure\neverything is working as it should be. The cost for these audits can start\nfrom \u00a31000 each time and again are affected by the method of editing, who\nconducts it, and any work that is needed to fix issues that may have arisen.\n\nISO also required an annual surveillance audit at the end of years one and\ntwo. This should be straightforward as long as processes have been maintained,\nbut it will require additional work if some elements have fallen out of sync\nwith current business needs.\n\nBecause ISO 27001 also considers GDPR and other business-critical elements,\nROI can be experienced, and other processes are also made more efficient via\nongoing ISO maintenance.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.creative-n.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-implement-iso-27001/", "title": "How Much Does It Cost to Implement ISO 27001? - Creative Networks", "description": "A budget provides a financial roadmap essential for making wise decisions over a defined period.

{"page_content": "# When is an ISO 27001 certification required?\n\nISO standards are fundamentally an important part of our economy, as they\nensure the quality and safety of both products and services in international\ntrade. Companies can benefit from ISO standards because they can help reduce\ncosts through improved systems and processes.\n\nLikewise, they build consumer confidence - products and services that meet\ncertain standards and reassure consumers that they are safe and of good\nquality.  \n  \n\n##  **What is ISO 27001?**  \n\nAn **** ISO 27001 certification shows your customers, business partners, and\neven your employees that you recognize risk, assess the impact, and implement\nand enforce systematized controls to best limit damage to the organization and\nall of its connections.\n\nThe increased security of systems and their information intuitively creates\ntrust with customers and business partners.\n\n**In principle, any company with sensitive information can benefit from ISO\n27001.**\n\n **\u200d**  \n\n##  **When is an ISO 27001 certification mandatory?**  \n\nNormally, companies need to do an ISO 27001 certification when they are\nrequired to enforce their technical security and introduce a seamless legally\ncorrect use of IT in the organization. This is especially true for critical\ninfrastructures (KRITIS), which are organizations and facilities in Germany in\nthe fields of State and Administration, Food, Finance and Insurances, Water,\nMedia and Culture, Transport and Traffic, Information Technology and\nTelecommunication, Health and Energy.\n\nKRITIS organizations must prove that their IT Security is state of the art\naccording to \u00a78a BSIG. This means that an Information Security Management\nSystem (ISMS) needs to be implemented according to ISO 27001 or IT Grundschutz\nby BSI.\n\n\u200d **\u200d**\n\n##  **Why should other organizations besides KRITIS implement an ISMS?**\n\n **\u200d**  \nAs a result of the Cybersecurity Act and other standards, this is not only a\nfactual and liability law problem, but increasingly also a criminal law and\nexistential problem for companies, because the number of cyber attacks is\ncontinuously increasing.\n\nIn order to organize operational IT in a legally compliant manner, one should\nfollow recognized standards such as ISO 27001. The technical standards of DIN\nISO 27001 provide the guidelines that regulate the handling of in-house IT,\nbecause there is a legal obligation to ensure IT compliance.\n\nThis duty and responsibility of management to comply with the law or to ensure\ncompliance arises not only from the Cybersecurity Act, but also from the\nAdministrative Offenses Act, the Stock Corporation Act and the Limited\nLiability Companies Act. According to these, those responsible are obliged to\navert economic damage to the company and therefore not to tolerate violations\nof the law.\n\nDue to an increasingly networked society, there are ever larger and more\npiquant areas of attack, for example hydroelectric power plants, wind\nturbines, solar energy plants, biogas plants, coal-fired power plants and the\nsuper-gau, nuclear power plants. But cyberattacks can also put entire\ncommunities and swaths of land out of action, with attacks on local water and\nenergy supplies or simply on traffic lights. This adds a new dimension to the\nconcept of liability.  \n\u200d  \nAs a result of the aforementioned Cybersecurity Act, the operators of these\ncritical infrastructures, especially energy suppliers, but also e.g.\nhospitals, insurance, healthcare and financial companies, are obliged to take\nadequate protective measures. For this reason, stricter obligations, such as\nthe implementation of contact points for reporting security incidents to the\nGerman Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), have been imposed on\nsuch socially significant supply apparatuses.\n\nAlthough DIN ISO 27001 is based on the implementation of information security\ncontrols, none of these controls are generally binding for compliance with the\nstandard. This is because the standard recognizes that each organization has\nits own requirements when developing an ISMS and that not all controls are\nappropriate in each case.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.secfix.com/post/when-is-an-iso-27001-certification-required", "title": "Which industries require ISO 27001 certification?", "description": "ISO 27001 applies to any organization that needs to formalize business processes around information security, data protection & securing its information assets", "language": "en"}, "type": "Document"}

This can be done through training, awareness campaigns, and other communication initiatives.  \n  \n\n  * Develop a budget for information security: Develop a budget for information security that is proportionate to the risks you face. This budget should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis.  \n  \n\n  * Prioritise resources: Prioritise resources and focus on the areas where you are most vulnerable. This may involve investing in security controls that are most effective in mitigating the risks you face.  \n  \n\n  * Work with other departments: Work with other departments to ensure that you are all working towards the same goal of protecting information assets. This may involve sharing resources or developing joint security initiatives.  \n  \n\n  * Invest in training and development: Invest in training and development for your staff so that they have the skills and knowledge they need to protect information assets.\n\n##  \n\n## What are the benefits of having adequate resources for an ISMS?\n\nOrganisations that have adequate resources for their ISMS can enjoy a number\nof benefits, including:\n\n  * Increased protection of information assets  \n  \n\n  * Reduced risk of security incidents  \n  \n\n  * Increased compliance with regulations  \n  \n\n  * Improved efficiency and productivity  \n  \n\n  * Enhanced reputation and brand image\n\nBy ensuring that they have the necessary resources, organisations can improve\ntheir overall information security posture and reduce the risk of costly\nsecurity incidents.s", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/clause-7-1-resources-for-isms/", "title": "ISO 27001 requirement 7.1: Identify and allocate resources for ISMS", "description": "ISO 27001 clause 7.1 stipulates that organisations must allocate necessary resources for the establishment, maintenance, and enhancement of their ISMS.", "language": "en-gb"}, "type": "Document"}

It provides a framework for\norganisations to manage their information security risks and protect their\ninformation assets.\n\nClause 7.5 of ISO 27001:2022 deals with documented information. This clause\nrequires organisations to create and maintain documented information that is\nnecessary for the effective operation of their ISMS.\n\n## What is ISO 27001:2022 Clause 7.5?\n\nISO 27001:2022 Clause 7.5 revolves around the management of documented\ninformation within an organisation's information security management system\n(ISMS). Documented information is the lifeblood of any ISMS, as it\nencapsulates policies, procedures, and records essential details for securing\nsensitive data and maintaining the ISMS's effectiveness.\n\nThis clause states that the documented information should be:\n\nIdentified and described: Documented information must be clearly identified\nand described, including attributes like title, date, author, or reference\nnumber.\n\nFormatted and media: Organisations must define the format (e.g., language,\nsoftware version, graphics) and media (e.g., paper, electronic) for their\ndocumented information.\n\nReviewed and approved for suitability and adequacy: All documented information\nmust undergo a rigorous review and approval process to ensure its suitability\nand adequacy.\n\nControlled: The control of documented information is pivotal.

{"page_content": "ISO 27001 stands as a globally recognized standard that outlines what you need\nto do to protect your valuable information. It's like a playbook of guidelines\ndesigned to safeguard your organisation's critical data.\n\nClause 8 of ISO 27001 concerns the operation of the information security\nmanagement system (ISMS). It includes requirements for planning, implementing,\nand controlling the processes that are used to manage information security.\n\nWithin Clause 8, you'll come across 8.1, which deals with operational planning\nand control. This part of the standard requires organisations to carefully\nplan, put their plans into action, and oversee processes to meet information\nsecurity requirements.\n\n\n\n## What is the purpose of clause 8.1 operational planning and control?\n\nThe purpose of clause 8.1 is to ensure that the organisation has a systematic\napproach to managing its information security risks. By planning,\nimplementing, and controlling the processes that are used to manage\ninformation security, you can reduce the likelihood and impact of security\nincidents.\n\n\n\n## What is clause 8 of ISO 27001 concerned with?\n\nClause 8 of ISO 27001 is concerned with the following:\n\n  * Planning, implementing, and controlling the processes needed to meet information security requirements  \n  \n\n  * Monitoring and reviewing the operation of the ISMS  \n  \n\n  * Maintaining and improving the ISMS\n\n## What are the requirements of clause 8.1 of the standard?\n\nThe requirements of clause 8.1 are as follows:\n\n  * The organisation shall plan, implement, and control the processes needed to meet information security requirements.  \n  \n\n  * The organisation shall establish criteria for the processes.  \n  \n\n  * The organisation shall implement controls of the processes in accordance with the criteria.  \n  \n\n  * Documented information shall be available to the extent necessary to have confidence that the processes have been carried out as planned.  \n  \n\n  * The organisation shall control planned changes and review the consequences of unintended changes, taking action to mitigate any adverse effects as necessary.\n\n\n## Clause 8.1 on ISO 27001:2013 vs. ISO 27001:2022\n\nClause 8.1 of ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 27001:2022 are both on operational\nplanning and control. However, there are some key differences between the two\nclauses.\n\nIn ISO 27001:2013, the clause is simply called \"Operational control\". In ISO\n27001:2022, the clause is called \"Operational planning and control\". This\nchange reflects the fact that the clause is not just about controlling\nprocesses but also about planning and implementing them.\n\nAnother key difference is that ISO 27001:2022 requires organisations to\nestablish criteria for the processes. This means that organisations need to\ndefine what success looks like for each process and how they will measure it.\nISO 27001:2013 did not have this requirement.\n\nISO 27001:2022 also requires organisations to implement controls of the\nprocesses in accordance with the criteria. This means that organisations need\nto put in place measures to ensure that the processes are effective in meeting\ntheir objectives. ISO 27001:2013 only required organisations to implement\ncontrols.\n\nFinally, ISO 27001:2022 requires documented information to be available to the\nextent necessary to have confidence that the processes have been carried out\nas planned. This means that organisations need to keep records of their\nprocesses and the results of their activities. ISO 27001:2013 did not have\nthis requirement.\n\nOverall, the changes to clause 8.1 in ISO 27001:2022 are designed to make\nit more comprehensive and to provide organisations with more guidance on how\nto implement effective operational planning and control._\n\nHere is a table summarising the key differences between clause 8.1 in ISO\n27001:2013 and ISO 27001:2022:\n\n**Requirements** | **ISO 27001:2013  ** | **ISO 27001:2022  **  \n---|---|---  \nClause name | Operational control | Operational planning and control  \nRequirements to establish criteria for processes | No | Yes  \nRequirements to implement controls of the processes in accordance with the\ncriteria | No | Yes  \nRequirements for documented information | No | Yes  \n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClause 8.1 of ISO 27001 is an important requirement for organisations that\nwant to implement an effective ISMS.

{"page_content": "ISO 27001 is an international standard that provides a framework for managing\ninformation security. It is designed to help organisations protect their\ninformation assets from a variety of threats, including unauthorized access,\nuse, disclosure, modification, or destruction.\n\nClause 8.2 of ISO 27001 is concerned with information security risk\nassessment. This clause requires organisations to identify, assess, and\ncontrol the risks to their information assets.\n\n\n\n## What is ISO 27001 clause 8.2 information security risk assessment?\n\nISO 27001 clause 8.2 information security risk assessment is titled\n\"Information security risk assessment\". Information security risk assessment\nis a critical process for any organization that wants to protect its data and\nsystems. By identifying and assessing risks, organizations can take steps to\nmitigate them and prevent security incidents from occurring. A risk management\nprocess should be following:\n\n  * Systematic  \n  \n\n  * Documented  \n  \n\n  * Regularly reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\n## Asset-based risk management vs. scenario-based risk management\n\nThere are two main types of information security risk assessment: asset-based\nand scenario-based.\n\nAsset-based risk assessment focuses on identifying and assessing the risks to\nspecific information assets, such as customer data, financial data, and\nintellectual property.\n\n### Asset-based risk management process\n\nAsset-based risk assessment typically involves the following steps:\n\n  1. Identify the information assets that need to be protected.  \n  \n\n  2. Identify the threats and vulnerabilities that could affect each asset.  \n  \n\n  3. Assess the likelihood and impact of each threat and vulnerability.  \n  \n\n  4. Prioritize the risks based on their likelihood and impact.  \n  \n\n  5. Develop and implement mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to each asset.\n\n### Scenario-based risk management process\n\nScenario-based risk assessment typically involves the following steps:\n\n  1. Identify the business processes that need to be protected.  \n  \n\n  2. Identify the threats and vulnerabilities that could affect each business process.  \n  \n\n  3. Assess the likelihood and impact of each threat and vulnerability.  \n  \n\n  4. Prioritize the risks based on their likelihood and impact.  \n  \n\n  5. Develop and implement mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to each business process.\n\nScenario-based risk assessment focuses on identifying and assessing the risks\nto specific business processes. There are a number of benefits, including:\n\n  * It helps organizations to identify and assess risks that may not be obvious at first glance.  \n  \n\n  * It takes a more holistic view of the organization's information security risks.  \n  \n\n  * It helps organizations to prioritize their risk mitigation efforts.  \n  \n\n  * It helps organizations to communicate their information security risks to stakeholders in a more meaningful way.  \n  \n\n  * It can help organizations to continually improve their information security management system.\n\nThe risk assessment process should identify the following:\n\n  * The organisation's information assets  \n  \n\n  * The threats and vulnerabilities that could impact those assets  \n  \n\n  * The likelihood and impact of those threats and vulnerabilities  \n  \n\n  * The controls that are in place to mitigate the risks\n\nClause 8.2 is one of the most important clauses in the standard, as it is the\nfoundation for all other information security controls.\n\n## What are the key aspects of clause 8.2?\n\nISO 27001 clause 8.2 requires organizations to conduct information security\nrisk assessments at planned intervals or when significant changes are proposed\nor occur.\n\nThe purpose of the risk assessment is to identify and evaluate the risks to\nthe organization's information assets. The risk assessment should consider the\nfollowing factors:\n\n  * The likelihood of a threat occurring  \n  \n\n  * The impact of a threat occurring  \n  \n\n  * The effectiveness of existing controls  \n  \n\n  * The need for additional controls\n\nOnce the risks have been identified and evaluated, the organization can\ndevelop and implement mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to an\nacceptable level.\n\nThe key aspects of clause 8.2 are:\n\n  * The need to identify all of the organisation's information assets or the scenarios where risks can occur  \n  \n\n  * The need to identify all of the threats and vulnerabilities that could impact those assets or scenarios that could be impacted by them  \n  \n\n  * The need to assess the likelihood and impact of those threats and vulnerabilities  \n  \n\n  * The need to implement controls to mitigate the risks  \n  \n\n  * The need to regularly review and update the risk assessment process\n\n### What are the 3 key elements information security in ISO 27001?\n\nThe three key elements of information security in ISO 27001 are:\n\nConfidentiality\n\nConfidentiality is the protection of information from unauthorised disclosure.\nThis means that only authorised individuals should be able to see or access\nthe information. Confidential information could include things like financial\ndata, customer records, or intellectual property.\n\nThere are many ways to protect confidentiality, such as:\n\n  * Using strong passwords and access controls  \n  \n\n  * Encrypting sensitive data  \n  \n\n  * Limiting access to sensitive areas  \n  \n\n  * Implementing data loss prevention (DLP) solutions\n\nIntegrity\n\nIntegrity is the protection of information from unauthorised modification.\nThis means that information should only be changed by authorised individuals\nand in a controlled manner. Any changes to information should be logged and\ntracked.\n\nThere are many ways to protect integrity, such as:\n\n  * Using checksums and hash functions to verify the authenticity of data  \n  \n\n  * Implementing change management procedures  \n  \n\n  * Using version control systems  \n  \n\n  * Regularly backing up data\n\nAvailability\n\nAvailability is the protection of information from unauthorised destruction or\ndisruption. This means that information should be available to authorised\nusers when they need it.\n\nThere are many ways to protect availability, such as:\n\n  * Using redundant systems and backups  \n  \n\n  * Implementing disaster recovery plans  \n  \n\n  * Keeping systems up to date with security patches  \n  \n\n  * Monitoring systems for signs of attack\n\nThe three key elements of information security are interrelated. For example,\nif confidentiality is compromised, then integrity and availability may also be\ncompromised. Therefore, it is important to implement appropriate controls to\nprotect all three elements.\n\n### Does ISO 27001 require a risk assessment?\n\nCertainly, ISO 27001 places significant emphasis on conducting a comprehensive\nrisk assessment. This requirement serves as the bedrock of the entire\ninformation security framework outlined in the standard.\n\nThe risk assessment is the foundation for all other information security\ncontrols in ISO 27001 because it helps organisations to:\n\n  * Identify the risks that their information assets or scenarios face  \n  \n\n  * Assess the likelihood and impact of those risks  \n  \n\n  * Prioritise the risks based on their severity  \n  \n\n  * Select appropriate controls to mitigate the risks  \n  \n\n  * Monitor and review the risk assessment process on a regular basis\n\nThe risk assessment should be conducted on a regular basis, and it should be\nupdated as the organisation's information assets/scenarios and threats change.\nThe results of the risk assessment should be used to prioritise the\nimplementation of information security controls.\n\nIn essence, ISO 27001 not only mandates a risk assessment but positions it as\na fundamental and ongoing activity that underpins the entire information\nsecurity management system. It's not merely a requirement; it's a strategic\nimperative for organisations seeking to safeguard their valuable information\nand mitigate security risks effectively.\n\n### How to conduct an ISO 27001 risk assessment?\n\nThere are many different ways to do an ISO 27001 risk assessment. However, the\nfollowing steps are generally involved:\n\n  * Identify the organisation's information assets.  \n  \n\n  * Identify the threats and vulnerabilities that could impact those assets/scenarios.  \n  \n\n  * Assess the likelihood and impact of those threats and vulnerabilities.  \n  \n\n  * Implement controls to mitigate the risks.  \n  \n\n  * Regularly review and update the risk assessment process.\n\n### Is ISO 27001 risk based?\n\nYes, ISO 27001 is a risk-based standard because it recognises that the level\nof risk that an organisation faces will vary depending on a number of factors,\nsuch as the type of information that it processes, the size and complexity of\nthe organisation, and the threats and vulnerabilities that it faces.\n\nThe risk-based approach of ISO 27001 is reflected in a number of clauses in\nthe standard, including:\n\n  * **Clause 4.1**, which requires organisations to define their information security policy, which should be based on the organisation's risk assessment  \n  \n\n  * **Clause 6.1**, which requires organisations to identify their assets and their associated risks  \n  \n\n  * **Clause 8.2** , which requires organisations to conduct a risk assessment to identify, assess, and prioritise the risks to their information assets  \n  \n\n  * **Clause 8.3**, which requires organisations to select and implement appropriate controls to mitigate the risks to their information assets\n\nThe risk-based approach of ISO 27001 allows organisations to tailor their\ninformation security controls to the specific risks that they face. This helps\nto ensure that organisations are only implementing controls that are necessary\nand proportionate to the risks, which can help to reduce the cost of\ninformation security.\n\nOverall, this approach is a valuable tool that can help organisations to\nimprove their information security posture and protect their most valuable\nassets.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/clause-8-2-information-security-risk-assessment/", "title": "ISO 27001 Clause 8.2: Information security risk assessment ", "description": "Learn about ISO 27001 clause 8.2, requiring organisations to conduct a risk assessment to identify, assess & prioritize risks to their information assets.

{"page_content": "Information security risk treatment is the process of selecting and\nimplementing controls to reduce the likelihood and impact of information\nsecurity risks. It is an essential part of any information security management\nsystem (ISMS) and is required by the ISO 27001 standard.\n\nClause 8.3 of ISO 27001 requires organisations to implement the information\nsecurity risk treatment plan and retain documented information on the results\nof that risk treatment.\n\nThis means that organisations must have a plan in place for how they will\naddress the risks that have been identified, and they must keep records of how\nthey have implemented that plan.\n\nHere are some of the things that are involved in requirement 8.3:\n\n  * Identifying and assessing risks  \n  \n\n  * Developing and implementing risk treatment plans  \n  \n\n  * Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of risk treatment plans  \n  \n\n  * Retaining documented information on the results of risk treatment\n\nOrganisations can use a variety of methods to implement requirement 8.3, such\nas:\n\n  * Using a risk management framework such as ISO 27005  \n  \n\n  * Using a risk management software tool  \n  \n\n  * Hiring a consultant to help with risk management\n\n\n## What is the information risk treatment plan?\n\nAn information risk treatment plan (IRTP) is a document that outlines how an\norganisation will manage and treat the information security risks that have\nbeen identified through its risk assessment process. The IRTP should include\nthe following:\n\n  * A list of all identified risks, along with their likelihood and impact  \n  \n\n  * A description of the risk treatment strategies that will be used to address each risk  \n  \n\n  * A list of the controls that will be implemented to support the risk treatment strategies  \n  \n\n  * A timeline for implementing the controls  \n  \n\n  * A plan for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk treatment plan\n\nThe IRTP should be a living document that is updated regularly as the\norganization's risk landscape changes.\n\n## What are the four risk treatment options?\n\nThere are a number of different risk treatment strategies, but the most common\nare:\n\n  * Avoidance: This involves taking steps to eliminate the risk altogether, such as by not using a particular technology or process.  \n  \n\n  * Mitigation: This involves taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk, such as by implementing security controls.  \n  \n\n  * Acceptance: This involves accepting the risk as it is and taking no further action.  \n  \n\n  * Transfer: This involves transferring the risk to a third party, such as an insurance company.\n\nThe best risk treatment strategy for a particular risk will depend on a number\nof factors, including the likelihood and impact of the risk, the cost and\neffectiveness of different controls, and the organisation's risk appetite.\n\n## How to implement information security risk treatment\n\nTo implement an information security risk treatment plan, organisations should\nfollow a risk management process.\n\n  1. Identify risks: The first step is to identify all of the information security risks that face the organisation. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as risk assessments, threat modelling, and vulnerability scans.\n  2. Assess risks: Once the risks have been identified, they need to be assessed to determine their likelihood and impact. This information can then be used to prioritise the risks and select the most appropriate risk treatment strategies.\n  3. Treat risks: Once the risk treatment strategies have been selected, they need to be implemented. This may involve implementing new security controls, updating existing controls, or changing processes.\n  4. Monitor and review risks: The risk management process is an ongoing one, and risks should be monitored and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they are being effectively managed.\n\nThe ISO 27001 standard requires organizations to have a risk treatment plan in\nplace to address the information security risks that have been identified\nthrough the risk assessment process.\n\nThe risk treatment plan should identify the risks, the risk treatment\nstrategies that will be used to address the risks, and the controls that will\nbe implemented to support the risk treatment strategies.\n\nThe risk treatment plan is important for the ISO 27001 certification process\nbecause it demonstrates to the auditor that the organization has a plan in\nplace to manage its information security risks. The auditor will review the\nrisk treatment plan to assess whether it is comprehensive and appropriate for\nthe organization's risks.\n\n## The benefits of having an information risk treatment plan\n\nIn addition to being required for the ISO 27001 certification, a risk\ntreatment plan also has a number of other benefits, such as:\n\n  * Reduced risk of information security incidents: An information risk treatment plan helps organisations to identify and manage their information security risks effectively. This can help to reduce the likelihood and impact of information security incidents, such as data breaches, malware attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.  \n  \n\n  * Improved compliance: Many regulatory requirements require organisations to have an information risk treatment plan in place. Having a plan can help organisations to demonstrate to regulators that they are taking steps to protect their information assets.  \n  \n\n  * Enhanced customer confidence: Customers are more likely to do business with organisations that they trust to protect their data. Having an information risk treatment plan can help organisations demonstrate to customers that they are taking information security seriously.  \n  \n\n  * Reduced costs: Information security incidents can be very costly, both in terms of financial losses and reputational damage. Having an information risk treatment plan can help organisations to reduce the risk of these incidents, which can lead to significant cost savings.  \n  \n\n  * Improved business continuity: Information security incidents can disrupt business operations and lead to lost revenue. Having an information risk treatment plan can help organisations improve their business continuity by reducing the risk of these incidents.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, having an information risk treatment plan can\nalso help organisations to:\n\n  * Make better decisions about information security investments: By understanding their risks, organisations can make more informed decisions about where to invest their resources in terms of information security controls.  \n  \n\n  * Improve communication and collaboration: An information risk treatment plan can help to improve communication and collaboration between different departments within an organization. This can lead to a more effective and efficient approach to information security.  \n  \n\n  * Raise awareness of information security risks: An information risk treatment plan can help to raise awareness of information security risks among employees. This can lead to more informed and responsible behaviour in terms of information security.\n\nOverall, an information risk treatment plan is an essential tool for any\norganisation that wants to protect its information assets and improve its\ninformation security posture.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/clause-8-3-information-security-risk-treatment/", "title": "ISO 27001 Clause 8.3: Information security risk treatment", "description": "Learn how to implement the ISO 27001 information security risk treatment plan and reduce the likelihood and impact of information security risks.", "language": "en-gb"}, "type": "Document"}

This involves taking action to address any weaknesses that are identified in the ISMS or its controls.\n\nOrganisations should also ensure that their monitoring and measurement program\nis aligned with their overall information security strategy and that it is\nregularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it is effective.\n\nHere are some additional tips for implementing an effective monitoring and\nmeasurement program for ISMS:\n\n  * Make sure that the program is tailored to the specific needs of the organisation.  \n  \n\n  * Use a variety of monitoring and measurement techniques to get a complete picture of the ISMS's performance.  \n  \n\n  * Regularly analyze the data collected to identify trends and patterns.  \n  \n\n  * Use the results of the analysis to improve the ISMS.  \n  \n\n  * Communicate the results of the monitoring and measurement program to relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n\n## What are KPIs for ISO 27001?\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) are measurable values that are used to track\nand measure the performance of a system or process. KPIs can be used to\nmeasure the effectiveness of an ISO 27001 information security management\nsystem.\n\nSome common KPIs for ISO 27001 include:\n\n  * Number of information security incidents  \n  \n\n  * Time to detect and respond to information security incidents  \n  \n\n  * Cost of information security incidents  \n  \n\n  * Compliance with information security regulations and standards  \n  \n\n  * Percentage of information security controls that are implemented and effective  \n  \n\n  * Percentage of ISMS processes that are completed on time and to budget  \n  \n\n  * Level of employee satisfaction with the ISMS\n\nOrganisations can also develop custom KPIs that are specific to their own ISMS\nand information security objectives.\n\nIt is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all set of KPIs to\nachieve ISO 27001 certification. The specific KPIs that are most relevant for\nan organisation will vary depending on its size, industry, and risk profile.\n\nOnce the KPIs have been selected, organisations should regularly monitor and\nmeasure their performance against these KPIs. This will help them to identify\nareas where the ISMS can be improved.\n\n## Benefits of ISO 27001 9.1 MMAE\n\nThere are many benefits to implementing an ISO 27001 9.1 MMAE program,\nincluding:\n\n  * **Improved information security posture:** By regularly monitoring and measuring the performance of the ISMS, organisations can identify and address weaknesses in their information security controls. This can help to improve the overall security posture of the organisation.  \n  \n\n  * **Reduced risk of information security incidents:** By identifying and addressing weaknesses in the ISMS, organisations can reduce the risk of information security incidents occurring.  \n  \n\n  * **Improved compliance:** An ISO 27001 9.1 MMAE program can help organisations comply with various regulations and standards, such as the ISO 27001 framework or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  \n  \n\n  * **Increased confidence from stakeholders:** An ISO 27001 9.1 MMAE program can help to increase confidence from stakeholders, such as customers, partners and investors, that the organisation is taking steps to protect its information assets.\n\n## How to Implement an ISO 27001 9.1 MMAE Program\n\nTo implement an ISO 27001 9.1 MMAE program, organisations should follow these\nsteps:\n\n  1.

{"page_content": "One of the key requirements to obtain an ISO 27001 certification is to conduct\nregular internal audits of the information security management system (ISMS).\nInternal audits help organisations to identify and address any weaknesses in\ntheir ISMS and to ensure that it is operating effectively.\n\n## What is an ISO 27001 Internal Audit?\n\nAn ISO 27001 internal audit is an independent assessment of the ISMS to\ndetermine whether it is conforming to the requirements of ISO 27001 and\nwhether it is operating effectively. The audit is conducted by an internal\nauditor who is independent of the ISMS being audited.\n\n\n\n## Why are ISO 27001 Internal Audits Important?\n\nISO 27001 internal audits are important for a number of reasons:\n\n  * To comply with ISO 27001: ISO 27001 requires organisations to conduct regular internal audits of their ISMS.  \n  \n\n  * To identify and address weaknesses in the ISMS: Internal audits can help organisations identify weaknesses in their information security management system (ISMS) before they are exploited by attackers.  \n  \n\n  * To improve the effectiveness of the ISMS: Internal audits can help organisations identify areas where the ISMS can be improved.  \n  \n\n  * To provide assurance to stakeholders: Internal audits can provide assurance to stakeholders that the ISMS is operating effectively and that the organisation is taking steps to protect its sensitive information.\n\n## Does ISO 27001 require an internal audit?\n\nYes, ISO 27001 requires organisations to conduct regular internal audits of\ntheir information security management system. This is stated in Clause 9.2 of\nthe standard, which states that:\n\nThe organisation shall conduct internal audits at planned intervals to provide\ninformation on whether the ISMS:\n\n  1. conforms to the organisation's own requirements for its information security management system; and  \n  \n\n  2. meets the requirements of this international standard.\n\nThe standard does not specify how often internal audits should be conducted,\nbut it is recommended that they be conducted at least annually.\n\nInternal audits are an important part of maintaining an effective ISMS. They\nhelp organisations to identify and address any weaknesses in their ISMS before\nthey are exploited by attackers.\n\n\n\n## What are ISO 27001 internal audit requirements?\n\nISO 27001 audit requirements:\n\n  * The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who is qualified to audit ISO 27001.  \n  \n\n  * The audit must be planned and conducted in accordance with a documented audit methodology.  \n  \n\n  * The audit must cover all aspects of the ISMS, including risk assessment, information security controls, ISMS documentation, awareness and training, and management review.  \n  \n\n  * The audit findings must be documented in a report that is submitted to the organisation's management.\n\nOrganisations that are certified according to ISO 27001 must also undergo an\nexternal audit by a certification body. There are two kinds of external audit,\none conducted once annually called a surveillance audit where the ISMS will be\nreviewed as part of ongoing evaluation and the other known as a full external\naudit which is more in-depth and conducted every three years.\n\nBenefits of ISO 27001 audit:\n\n  * Improved information security posture  \n  \n\n  * Reduced risk of information security incidents  \n  \n\n  * Increased compliance with regulations  \n  \n\n  * Improved customer confidence  \n  \n\n  * Competitive advantage\n\nIf you are considering implementing ISO 27001 or if you are already certified,\nit is important to ensure that you are conducting regular internal audits.\nInternal audits are an essential tool for maintaining an effective ISMS and\nprotecting your organisation from information security threats.\n\n\n\n## Where is an internal audit mandatory?\n\nAn internal audit is not required by law or regulation. However, it is a good\npractice for all organisations to conduct regular internal audits of their\ninformation security and other management systems.\n\nIn order to comply with ISO 27001, all companies must conduct internal audits,\nno matter their country or industry.\n\n## How to plan and conduct an ISO 27001 internal audit\n\nTo plan and conduct an ISO 27001 internal audit, organisations should follow\nthe following steps:\n\n  1. **Define the scope of the audit:** The first step is to define the scope of the audit. This includes identifying the ISMS processes and controls that will be audited.  \n  \n\n  2. **Develop an audit plan:** The next step is to develop an audit plan. This plan should identify the audit objectives, the audit methodology, and the audit resources required.  \n  \n\n  3. **Conduct the audit:** The audit should be conducted in accordance with the audit plan. This involves interviewing staff, reviewing documentation, and observing processes.  \n  \n\n  4. **Document the audit findings:** The audit findings should be documented in a report. This report should include the audit objectives, the audit methodology, the audit findings, and any recommendations for improvement.  \n  \n\n  5. **Follow up on the audit findings:** The organisation should follow up on the audit findings and implement any necessary corrective actions.\n\n\n## What to look for during an ISO 27001 internal audit\n\nDuring an ISO 27001 internal audit, the auditor will look for evidence that\nthe ISMS is conforming to the requirements of ISO 27001 and that it is\noperating effectively. The auditor will focus on the following areas and\nevidence that supports them:\n\n  * Risk assessment: The auditor will assess whether the organisation has conducted a thorough risk assessment and whether the identified risks have been appropriately addressed.  \n  \n\n  * Information security controls: The auditor will assess whether the organisation has implemented and is maintaining appropriate information security controls to mitigate the identified risks.  \n  \n\n  * ISMS documentation: The auditor will assess whether the ISMS is adequately documented. You can find a list of the required documentation for the ISO 27001 certification here.  \n  \n\n  * Awareness and training: The auditor will assess whether staff are aware of their information security responsibilities and have received appropriate training.  \n  \n\n  * Management review: The auditor will assess whether the organisation conducts regular management reviews of the ISMS.\n\n\n## How to report on the findings of an ISO 27001 internal audit\n\nThe audit findings should be documented in a report. This report should\ninclude the following:\n\n  * Audit objectives: The audit objectives should be clearly stated in the report.  \n  \n\n  * Audit methodology: The audit methodology should be described in the report. This includes the audit techniques that were used and the sampling methods that were applied.  \n  \n\n  * Audit findings: The audit findings should be described in the report. This includes a description of any weaknesses that were identified in the ISMS.  \n  \n\n  * Recommendations: The report should include any recommendations for improvement.\n\nThe audit report should be submitted to the organisation's management", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/clause-9-2-internal-audit/", "title": "ISO 27001 Clause 9.2: Internal Audit", "description": "Ensure your ISMS is operating effectively for ISO 27001 compliance.

{"page_content": "ISO 27001:2022 Clause 9.3 Management Review is a critical component of the\nInformation Security Management System (ISMS). It requires top management to\nreview the ISMS at regular intervals to ensure that it remains suitable,\nadequate, and effective.\n\nThe management review is an opportunity for top management to assess the\noverall performance of the ISMS and to identify areas for improvement. It is\nalso an opportunity to communicate the importance of information security to\nthe rest of the organisation.\n\n\n\n## Benefits of the management review\n\nThe management review offers a number of benefits, including:\n\n  * **Improved information security posture:** By regularly reviewing the ISMS, top management can identify and address potential security risks. This can help to improve the overall security posture of the organisation.  \n  \n\n  * **Increased compliance:** The management review is a requirement of ISO 27001:2022 certification. By conducting regular management reviews, organisations can demonstrate their commitment to compliance with the standard.  \n  \n\n  * **Enhanced business performance:** An effective ISMS can help organisations improve their business performance by protecting their information assets from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.\n\n\n\n## How to conduct a management review\n\nThe management review should be conducted at regular intervals, such as\nannually or semi-annually. The review should be led by top management and\nshould involve all relevant stakeholders, such as the information security\nofficer, department heads, and business unit managers.\n\nThe management review should consider the following inputs:\n\n  * **Status of actions from previous management reviews:** The review should assess the progress made in implementing any corrective actions from previous management reviews.  \n  \n\n  * **Changes in external and internal issues that are relevant to the ISMS:** The review should consider any changes in the organisation\u2019s external or internal environment that could impact the ISMS.  \n  \n\n  * **Feedback on the information security performance, including trends:** The review should consider feedback on the information security performance, such as audit results, incident reports, and customer feedback.  \n  \n\n  * **Non-conformities and corrective actions:** The review should consider any non-conformities that have been identified and the corrective actions that have been taken.  \n  \n\n  * **Monitoring and measurement results:** The review should consider the results of monitoring and measurement activities, such as risk assessments and performance reviews.\n\nThe outputs of the management review should include:\n\n  * **Decisions and directions for the ISMS:** The review should result in decisions and directions for the continuous improvement of the ISMS.  \n  \n\n  * **Recommendations for improvement:** The review should identify any recommendations for improvement, such as new security controls, changes to existing security controls, or additional resources.  \n  \n\n  * **Actions to be taken:** The review should identify any actions that need to be taken to address any non-conformities or to implement any recommendations for improvement.\n\n## How often should management review the ISMS?\n\nThe ISO 27001:2022 standard requires management to review the ISMS at planned\nintervals with experts recommending that at a minimum it is conducted least\nonce a year. However, it is considered back practise that management reviews\nare conducted more frequently, especially for organisations that operate in\nhigh-risk environments or that experience significant changes to their\nbusiness or IT environment.\n\nThe frequency of management reviews should be determined based on a number of\nfactors, including:\n\n  * The size and complexity of the organization  \n  \n\n  * The nature of the organisation\u2019s business  \n  \n\n  * The level of risk associated with the organisation\u2019s information assets.  \n  \n\n  * The frequency of changes to the organisation\u2019s business or IT environment  \n  \n\n  * The results of previous management reviews\n\nFor example, a small organisation with a relatively simple ISMS may be able to\nconduct management reviews annually. However, a large organisation with a\ncomplex ISMS and a high-risk environment may need to conduct management\nreviews quarterly or even more frequently.\n\nIt is important to note that the management review is not just a one-time\nevent. It is an ongoing process that helps to ensure that the ISMS remains\neffective and aligned with the organisation\u2019s business needs.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe management review is an essential component of complying with ISO 27001\nand maintaining a compliant ISMS. By conducting regular management reviews,\norganisations can improve their information security posture, increase\ncompliance, and enhance business performance.\n\n\n\n## Additional tips for conducting an effective management review.\n\nHere are some additional tips for conducting an effective management review:\n\n  * **Prepare for the review:** The management review should be planned in advance and all relevant documentation should be prepared.  \n  \n\n  * **Involve relevant stakeholders:** The management review should involve all relevant stakeholders, such as the information security officer, department heads, and business unit managers.  \n  \n\n  * **Be objective:** The management review should be conducted in an objective and impartial manner.  \n  \n\n  * **Be thorough:** The management review should consider all relevant inputs and should result in comprehensive outputs.  \n  \n\n  * **Take action:** The management review should result in decisions and actions to improve the ISMS.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/clause-9-3-management-review/", "title": "ISO 27001 Clause 9.3: Management review", "description": "What is covered by ISO 27001 clause 9.3?

{"page_content": "Clause 10.2 of ISO 27001 requires organisations to identify, investigate, and\nresolve nonconformities. A nonconformity is a departure from the requirements\nof the ISMS.\n\nThis article will discuss the requirements of ISO 27001 clause 10.2 and\nprovide guidance on how to implement a nonconformity and corrective action\nprocess in order to achieve or maintain an ISO 27001 certification.\n\n### What is a nonconformity in ISO 27001?\n\nNonconformities can be identified through a variety of means, such as internal\naudits, management reviews, and external audits. Once a nonconformity has been\nidentified, the organisation should investigate it to determine the root cause\nand any potential impact on information security.\n\n\n## What is the difference between minor nonconformities and major\nnonconformities?\n\nThe difference between minor nonconformities and major nonconformities is the\nseverity of the impact on the organisation's information security management\nsystem.\n\nMinor nonconformities are those that do not have a significant impact on the\neffectiveness of the ISMS. They may be isolated incidents or one-off\noccurrences. Minor nonconformities can be dealt with relatively quickly and\neasily, and they do not necessarily require immediate corrective action.\n\nMajor nonconformities, on the other hand, are those that have a significant\nimpact on the effectiveness of the ISMS. They may be systemic problems that\ncould lead to serious information security risks. Major nonconformities\nrequire immediate corrective action to mitigate the risk and prevent further\nproblems.\n\nHere is a table that summarizes the key differences between minor and major\nnonconformities:\n\nCharacteristic | Minor nonconformity | Major nonconformity**\n---|---|---  \nSeverity of impact | Does not have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the ISMS. | Has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the ISMS.  \n  \nLikelihood of occurrence | Isolated incident or one-off occurrence. | Systemic problem that could lead to serious information security risks.  \n  \nTime to resolution | Relatively quick and easy. | Immediate corrective action required.  \n  \nImpact on certification | May not affect certification. | May affect certification.  \n  \nIt is important to note that the severity of a nonconformity can vary\ndepending on the specific circumstances of the organisation. For example, a\nminor nonconformity for one organisation could be a major nonconformity for\nanother organisation.\n\nHere are some examples of minor and major nonconformities:\n\n  * **Minor nonconformity:** A security policy is not up to date.  \n  \n\n  * **Major nonconformity:** A firewall is misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access to the organisation's network.  \n  \n\n  * **Minor nonconformity:** A user account is not properly disabled when an employee leaves the organisation.  \n  \n\n  * **Major nonconformity:** A data breach occurs due to a lack of security controls.  \n  \n\n  * **Minor nonconformity:** A security training session is not conducted on time.  \n  \n\n  * **Major nonconformity:** Employees are not following security procedures, such as using strong passwords and avoiding phishing emails.\n\nOrganisations should have a process in place for identifying, reporting, and\nresolving both minor and major nonconformities. This process should be\ndocumented and communicated to all employees.\n\nBy promptly addressing nonconformities, organisations can help to improve the\noverall effectiveness of their ISMS and protect their information assets.\n\n### What are corrective actions in ISO 27001?\n\nOnce the root cause of a nonconformity has been determined, the organisation\nshould take corrective action to eliminate the cause and prevent it from\nhappening again. Corrective action may involve changing policies and\nprocedures, training employees, or implementing new security controls.\n\n\n## Nonconformity and corrective action process\n\nThe following is a general overview of the nonconformity and corrective action\nprocess:\n\n  1. **Identify the nonconformity:** This can be done through a variety of means, such as internal audits, management reviews, and customer feedback.  \n  \n\n  2. **Investigate the nonconformity:** Determine the root cause of the nonconformity and any potential impact to information security.  \n  \n\n  3. **Determine corrective action:** Identify the steps that need to be taken to eliminate the root cause of the nonconformity and prevent it from happening again.  \n  \n\n  4. **Implement corrective action:** Take the steps that were identified in step 3.  \n  \n\n  5. **Verify the effectiveness of the corrective action:** Once the corrective action has been implemented, verify that it has eliminated the root cause of the nonconformity and prevented it from happening again.\n\n## What will auditors check while validating Clause 10.2 that is nonconformity\nand corrective action?\n\nTo prepare for the external audit, it is helpful to understand common areas,\ntopics, and questions an auditor may ask or check. The following list gives an\noverview of potential areas auditors may check while validating clause 10.2 of\nISO 27001:\n\n  * Whether the organisation has a process for identifying, investigating, and resolving nonconformities.  \n  \n\n  * Whether the process is documented and communicated to employees.  \n  \n\n  * Whether the organisation has assigned responsibility for each step of the process.  \n  \n\n  * Whether the organisation is monitoring the effectiveness of the process.  \n  \n\n  * Whether the organisation is taking appropriate corrective action to eliminate the root causes of nonconformities and prevent them from happening again.\n\nSpecifically, the auditor will check the following:\n\n  * **Nonconformity identification:** Does the organisation have a process for identifying nonconformities? This process may include internal audits, management reviews, employee feedback, and customer feedback.  \n  \n\n  * **Nonconformity investigation:** Does the organisation have a process for investigating nonconformities? This process should identify the root cause of the nonconformity and any potential impact on information security.  \n  \n\n  * **Corrective action:** Does the organisation have a process for determining and implementing corrective action? Corrective action should be taken to eliminate the root cause of the nonconformity and prevent it from happening again.  \n  \n\n  * **Verification of corrective action:** Does the organisation verify the effectiveness of corrective action? This may involve monitoring the process, testing the controls, or conducting follow-up audits.\n\nThe auditor will also review the organisation's records of nonconformities and\ncorrective actions.\n\n### Here are some additional questions that the auditor may ask:\n\n  * How does the organisation identify nonconformities?  \n  \n\n  * How does the organisation investigate nonconformities?  \n  \n\n  * How does the organisation determine corrective action?  \n  \n\n  * How does the organisation implement corrective action?  \n  \n\n  * How does the organisation verify the effectiveness of corrective action?  \n  \n\n  * What are some examples of nonconformities that the organisation has identified and resolved?  \n  \n\n  * What are some examples of corrective actions that the organisation has implemented?\n\nBy asking these questions and reviewing the organisation's records, the\nauditor can assess the effectiveness of the organisation's nonconformity and\ncorrective action process. Therefore, preparing for these questions will\nfacilitate the audit process and increases the chances of successfully passing\nthe external ISO 27001 audit.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe nonconformity and corrective action process is an essential part of an\nISMS. By identifying and resolving nonconformities, organisations can improve\nthe effectiveness of their ISMS and reduce the risk of information security\nincidents.\n\n### Additional Tips for Implementing a Nonconformity and Corrective Action\nProcess\n\nMake sure that the process is well-defined and documented. This will help to\nensure that all nonconformities are handled in a consistent manner.\n\nAssign responsibility for each step of the process. This will help to ensure\nthat nonconformities are resolved promptly and effectively.\n\nCommunicate the process to all employees. This will help to ensure that\neveryone is aware of their role in the process.\n\nMonitor the effectiveness of the process. This will help to identify any areas\nfor improvement.\n\nBy following these tips, organisations can implement a nonconformity and\ncorrective action process that will help them to improve the security of their\ninformation assets.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/knowledge/iso-27001/clause-10-2-nonconformity-and-corrective-action/", "title": "ISO 27001 Clause 10.2: Nonconformity and Corrective Action", "description": "Identify & address Nonconformities in your ISMS to improve information security, according to ISO 27001 clause 10.2.

{"page_content": "## **What is an information security policy?**\n\nAn information security policy, often referred to as an _infosec policy_ , is\na set of regulations carefully designed to govern the access, use and\nretention of critical business information. These policies implement a robust\nframework of processes and tools to ensure absolute protection against\nunauthorised access, thereby safeguarding an organisation's sensitive\ninformation assets.\n\nInformation security policies follow a common structure and format. They\ninclude:\n\n  * A statement describing the types of activities covered by the policy\n  * A statement of commitment issued by management, providing evidence that management has assigned sufficient resources to support ongoing compliance with the policy\n  * A number of specific responsibilities for employees regarding their use and protection of organisational data. Note that most organisations should aim to employ a data protection officer, whose role it is to maintain and implement these changes as well as add solutions to data protection problems.\n\n## **What is Annex A.5?**\n\nThis Annex describes the concepts, requirements and recommendations related to\ninformation security policies. The purpose of this Annex is to describe the\nconcepts, requirements and recommendations related to information security\npolicies. It covers policy definition, implementation and review.\n\nIn addition to providing guidance on the implementation of information\nsecurity policies, Annex A.5 also addresses how to report on information\nsecurity policies and how they relate to other corporate policies.\n\nThe implementation of information security policies is a continuous process.\nAs new technologies emerge, threats evolve, and business operations change, it\nis crucial to update your information security policies on a regular basis.\nAdded to this, the government regularly pass new requirements for\norganisations to follow to protect against loss of data, with failure to do so\nresulting in large fines.\n\nIt is also advised to review your information security policies regularly.\nWhen you conduct these reviews, pay close attention to areas such as:\n\n  * **Communication** \\- Are all employees receiving the same training? Are they aware of the latest changes made to the policy?\n  * **Consistency** \\- Are all employees applying the same procedures when it comes time to enforce an action? For example, if there is a violation in one department but not another because someone used their personal cell phone at work (even though both are against organisational policy), that could be considered inconsistent enforcement.\n  * **Integrity:** When assigning system permissions, have the system users got minimum viable access rights, or do they have permissions that could compromise the integrity of the system unnecessarily?\n\n## **What is the objective of Annex A.5?**\n\nThe purpose of information security policies is to help protect an\norganisation\u2019s assets and operations from risks associated with cybersecurity.\nThey are meant to be flexible enough to cover different types of systems and\ntheir vulnerabilities, as well as multiple modes of operation, such as\ntraditional and cloud-based operations.\n\nInformation security policies are the documents that define the standards for\ninformation security within an organisation. They can be formal or informal.\nThis Annex describes how to develop an information security policy and how to\nimplement it in your organisation.\n\n## **What are the Annex A.5 information security policy controls?**\n\n### **A.5.1.1 Policies for information security**\n\nAccording to ISO 27001, all organisations must conduct themselves in a\ntransparent manner with their stakeholders. To protect their data, all\nstakeholders must be informed of the policies in place within the\norganisation.\n\nPolicies play a critical role throughout the whole information security\nprocess. Therefore, any policies created by the business must first be\nexamined, authorised, and then communicated to employees and third parties.\nThey must also be included in the A.7 human resource security control, and\nthey must be adhered to by all employees.\n\n### **A.5.1.2 Review of the policies for information security**\n\nTo keep updated with any changes, whether internal or external, the\norganisation's ISMS policies must be updated on a regular basis. Management\nchanges, governing laws, industry standards, and technology are examples of\nthese developments.\n\nThe documentation should always represent standards and procedures to preserve\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of files, and an information\nsecurity breach may result in policy change and improvement.\n\n## **Why is information security policy important for your organisation's\ninformation security management?**\n\nAn information security policy helps your organisation classify your\norganisations' sensitive data. This depends in part on applicable regulations,\nbut it should also take into account any external factors that could affect\nrisk perception, such as industry competition or geopolitical climate change.\n\nInformation classifications can range from low (confidential) through medium\n(secret), high (top secret), even top secret plus or beyond top secret. The\nexact terms used may vary slightly depending on which agency or company is\ncreating the policy.\n\nHowever, all organisations should understand ISO 27001 well so that those\ntasked with implementing it can understand what each control means. This\nbecomes much more poignant with the added knowledge that 70%-90% of hacks\ninvolve some form of social engineering.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nInformation security policies are the foundation of an ISMS (information\nsecurity management system). They provide guidance to develop the necessary\nactions and controls to achieve the organisation's information security\nobjectives over time. This all ties in with SIEM (security information event\nmanagement) as a form of countermeasure through proper processes and\nprocedures while analysing current and previous threat actors\u2019 attack patterns\nto better an organisation\u2019s defence strategy.\n\nEven though all Annex A controls are not mandatory to abide by, choosing Annex\nA.5 is highly recommended by data privacy experts at DataGuard.\n\nThis Annex is critical for your organisation as it protects organisational\ndata and IT resources and also helps businesses stay competitive and keep\ntheir clients' or consumers' trust.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a5-information-security-policies", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.5 - Information Security Policies - DataGuard", "description": "Annex A 5 is a set of policies that manage how information is stored and used.

{"page_content": "## What is Annex A.6?\n\nAccording to the ISO 27001 standard, the purpose of Annex A.6 is to \u201cestablish\na management framework to initiate and control the implementation & operation\nof information security within the organisation\u201d. It is a critical component\nof the Information Security Management System (ISMS), especially if you want\nto attain ISO 27001 certification.\n\nAnnex A.6 is subdivided into two sections. Annex A.6.1 and Annex A.6.2. A.6.1\nverifies that the organisation has obtained an ISO-compliant structure.\nInformation security is made easier to install and maintain with the aid of\nthis solution. A.6.2, on the other hand, focuses on mobile devices and remote\nworking. This practice is mainly for those who work from home or while\ntravelling, either part-time or full-time.\n\n## Annex A.6.1 : Internal Organisation\n\nIn Annex 6.1, the need for top management in the installation and control of\nthe ISMS is reemphasized. Mainly, because there needs to be order and\nstructure in the system operations in order to guarantee that it is effective.\n\n### Annex A.6.1.1: Information security roles and responsibilities\n\nThe management must define and approve all aspects of information security\nbefore they can be put into action. The obligations could be general (e.g.,\npreserving information) or specific (e.g., enforcing confidentiality). The\nfollowing tips can make understanding Annex 6.1.1 easier:\n\n  * According to ISO 27001 Annex 5.1.1, responsibility for information security should be assigned in accordance with the organisation's security policy.\n  * When determining the responsibility of types of information, it is important to take into account who owns certain information assets or categories of information assets.\n  * It is important that key staff members, such as CEOs, business owners, general managers, HR managers, and internal auditors, have access to information security.\n  * Responsibilities of individual asset security, information security risk management, and the execution of particular information security processes should all be outlined. Furthermore, local responsibility for asset protection and the implementation of particular security measures should be identified.\n  * Individuals who have been given responsibility for information security can delegate some of their duties to others. However, they are still accountable for ensuring that any activities outsourced by them are carried out appropriately.\n\n### Annex A.6.1.2: Segregation of duties\n\nTo minimise the chances of unauthorised or unintentional alteration or\nexploitation of the organisation's assets, it is necessary to divide\nconflicting duties and areas of responsibility.\n\nAccess, modification, and use of the assets will only be available to those\nwho have been granted permission or authorisation. This allows you to\ndistinguish between what happened and what was authorised. Controls should be\ndesigned with the possibility of collaboration in mind. Even if job division\nmay be impossible for smaller organisations, the idea should be followed to\nthe greatest extent possible. It is important to examine other options if\nsegregation is not an option, such as task reporting, audit trails, and\nincreased management oversight.\n\n### Annex A.6.1.3: Contact with authorities\n\nCommunication with the appropriate authorities must be kept open at all times.\nProcesses should be put in place to define when and with whom officials should\ncommunicate and how identified information security violations will be\nreported as soon as possible by organisations.\n\nOrganisations that have been attacked over the internet may compel authorities\nto take counter-measures. Maintaining these connections may also be required\nin information security to assist incident management or business continuity\nand contingency planning operations. Contacts with regulatory authorities are\nalso beneficial in predicting and planning for any changes in the rules or\nregulations that the organisation must enforce.\n\n### Annex A.6.1.4: Contact with interested groups\n\nSpecial Interest Groups (SIGs) are communities inside larger organisations\nthat have a common interest in a certain field of knowledge, learning, or\ntechnology. When working on a specific problem, the members can communicate,\nmeet, and plan conferences to work together to find answers in their specific\nsector. Those who need access to the information should only be granted the\nauthority to do so.\n\nYou should keep in mind that memberships in professional organisations, trade\nassociations, discussion groups, and forums all count toward this control when\ncustomising it to fit your needs. It is critical to comprehend the nature of\neach of these organisations and the reasons for their formation.\n\n### Annex A.6.1.5: Information Security in project management\n\nInformation security should be integrated into the organisation's project\nmanagement methods to guarantee that risks in information security are\nidentified and responded to as part of a project's implementation. Whatever\nthe project's goal, this approach may be used effectively.\n\nDuring the ISO 27001 certification process, the auditor will be seeking to\nensure that all personnel participating in projects are charged with\nconsidering information security at all phases of the project lifecycle. As\nstated in Annex A.7.2.2, education and awareness should also include this.\n\n## Annex A.6.2: Mobile devices and teleworking\n\nAccording to Annex 6.2, organisations aiming to achieve ISO 27001\ncertification must have a security strategy for teleworking and mobile devices\nin place as a condition of compliance. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) is an\noption. The whole mobile and networking infrastructure should be protected by\na secure channel that eliminates the risk of information security breaches.\n\n### Annex A.6.2.1: Mobile device policy\n\nThis policy issue is becoming increasingly important beyond the typical usage\nof a cell phone as mobile devices grow increasingly intelligent. The usage of\nmobile devices and telework is both a fantastic opportunity for flexible\nworking and a possible security risk.\n\nBYOD is also a crucial factor in the decision-making process. There are\nsignificant advantages in allowing employees to bring their own devices to\nwork, but without sufficient controls on usage and exit, the risks may be\nsubstantial as well.\n\nWhen mobile devices are utilised or employees are working off-site, an\norganisation must ensure that its information and that of its customers and\nother interested parties is safeguarded and, if possible, under its control.\nWhen operating away from the organisation's physical premises, an auditor will\nwant to examine these rules and procedures to ensure that information stays\nsafe. The following is a list of some areas that these policies should cover:\n\n  * Restrictions on software installations\n  * Updated and patching applications on devices\n  * Malware and anti-virus solutions\n  * Log out, remote disabling and \u2018find my device\u2019 requirements\n  * Connectivity and trusted networks\n  * Use of the device in public places and on public connections\n  * Backup and storage  \n\n### Annex A.6.2.2: Teleworking\n\nOne of the largest internal hazards to a company's data is posed by\nteleworking, remote working, or telecommuting especially in today's digital\nage, when commerce is increasingly conducted over the internet. While working\nremotely, auditors will check to determine if you have taken precautions to\nprevent data loss or harm.\n\nWhen seeking certification, Annex 6 is important to implement. When all of\nthese areas are well-covered, your firm is less likely to have data security\nloopholes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnnex A.6 is among the ISO 27001 controls that must be implemented in order to\nbe certified. It provides guidelines on how to implement and organise your\ninformation security measures efficiently. Whether your organisation is large\nor small, it is imperative in this digital age to take measures such as this\nto protect your information.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.6-organisation-information-security/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.6 - Organisation of Information  Security ", "description": "Annex A 6 focuses on the organisational InfoSec to apply best security practices for your ISMS.

{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A.7?**\n\nAnnex A.7 is the most well-structured of Annex A, and outlines the management\nsystem standards for workers and contractors before, during, and after\nemployment. It includes all HR duties such as recruiting, contracts,\nawareness, education, training, discipline, change, and termination.\n\nThe main goal of Annex A.7 is to guarantee that all employees, suppliers, and\ncontractors are qualified for and understand their engagement/job tasks and\nresponsibilities and that access is revoked after the engagement is finished.\n\nAlthough this may be the overarching goal, each control of Annex A.7 has its\nown objective.\n\n## **What is the objective of Annex A.7?**\n\nSimilar to cyber-attacks, your ISMS may be prone to human resource errors as\nwell. To counter errors, Annex A.7 provides 3 major security controls. They\nare:\n\n### **Annex A.7.1: Prior to employment**  \n\nThis Annex's goal is to guarantee that workers and contractors are aware of\ntheir obligations and are fit for the jobs they are being evaluated for. It\nalso covers what happens when employees resign, change roles or are\nterminated.\n\nTo action this, careful planning and a clear understanding of roles and duties\nare required. Individual Employment Agreements (IEAs) and Contractor\nAgreements (CAs) can be used to create well-defined job descriptions.\n\n### **Annex A.7.2: During employment**  \n\nThis section's goal is to ensure that all workers and contractors understand\nand fulfil their duties related to information security while on the job.\nThere may be a variety of approaches taken.\n\nStart with a well-structured induction. Integrate the concept of information\nsecurity into your new employee orientation programme. All your policies,\nasset management, system access, building access, password strength, malware,\nbackups, software controls, networks, buying, incidents, and business\ncontinuity will be covered depending on your system.\n\nImplement a programme of ongoing education and training for your whole\nworkforce next. Cover the above-mentioned topics. This is a continuous effort.\nIt is not enough to conduct one-time training and teaching sessions.\n\n\n\n### **Annex A.7.3 - Termination and change of employment**\n\nAnnex A.7.3 focuses on termination and job changes. It is the goal of this\nAnnex to safeguard the interests of the organisation during the process of\nmodifying and terminating employment arrangements.\n\nYou are required to have mechanisms in place to handle the situation when an\nemployee or contractor quits or changes jobs. The following questions would\nneed to be answered:\n\n  * What happens to your systems' integrity?\n  * Are there any permissions that need to be changed?\n  * How often do you alter your passwords?\n  * Have building passwords been altered?\n  * What happens to information stored on their work devices? And many more.\n\nThe core of understanding how to implement Annex A.7 controls is first\nunderstanding what human resource security is.\n\n## **What is human resource security?**\n\nThe human resource security clause evaluates controls before, during, and\nafter hiring a new employee. Controls include but are not limited to the\ndefinitions of roles and duties, recruitment, contract terms and conditions,\nawareness, education and training, disciplinary processes, and termination of\nactivities.\n\nReturn of assets and management of access privileges are also covered by the\ncontrols in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001's requirements for human resources\nsecurity.\n\n## **What are the Annex A.7 controls?**\n\nNow that you have an understanding of what Annex A.7 is and the objectives of\nits controls let's take a look at the individual controls under each of the\nmajor clauses.\n\n#### **A.7.1.1: Screening  **\n\nAll job applicants should be subjected to background checks and competency\nassessments as part of a thorough control. According to applicable laws,\nrules, and ethical standards, these procedures must be carried out in a manner\nthat is proportional to the business needs, the categorization of information\nthat will be accessed, and any potential hazards.\n\nA screening for contractors should also be performed even if the contractor's\nparent organisation fulfils your larger security measures, such as an ISO\n27001 certification and background checks.\n\n#### **A.7.1.2: Terms and conditions of employment**\n\nInformation security obligations should be explicitly stated in contracts with\nboth employees and contractors. Insist that all parties involved are aware of\nand familiar with NDAs, legal rights and duties, data processing, and the use\nof third-party information. It is critical that disciplinary measures are\nguided by certain policies within the organisation.\n\n#### **A.7.2.1: Management responsibilities**\n\nSenior-level management ensures all stakeholders know their information\nsecurity duties and responsibilities and are driven to perform them. They\nshould establish anonymous means for reporting information security\nviolations. Management buy-ins are crucial for a company's security culture.\nThis is when an outside manager or management team purchases a controlling\nownership stake in an outside company and replaces its existing management\nteam.\n\nAdditionally, it is the responsibility of managers to ensure that security\nawareness and conscientiousness are maintained across the organisation and to\nbuild an acceptable \"security culture.\"\n\n#### **A.7.2.2: Information security awareness, education and training**\n\nAll workers and, where necessary, contractors should get adequate awareness,\neducation and training, and frequent updates on organisational rules and\nprocedures.\n\nThe training and awareness must be presented in a way that your employees and\ncontractors have the best chance of understanding and following it. This\nentails paying attention to the content and the medium for delivery. This is\nimportant because auditors would want proof of your training and compliance.\n\n#### **A.7.2.3: Disciplinary process**\n\nEmployees who have violated company information security policies face\ndisciplinary action under a well-defined and stated disciplinary procedure.\n\nTo begin the disciplinary procedure, it must be established that an\ninformation security breach has happened first. Employees who are accused of\ncommitting data security breaches should undergo a formal disciplinary\nprocedure to guarantee that they are treated fairly.\n\n#### **A.7.3.1: Termination or change of employment responsibilities**\n\nThe employee's or contractor's terms and conditions of employment should\ninclude any responsibilities or tasks that remain in place after the employee\nor contractor's employment ends.\n\nChanges in responsibilities or employment should be handled at the end of the\npresent responsibility or job and the commencement of the new one. Also\nincluded are the return of company property and the termination of access\nprivileges, including physical access, to avoid security breaches.\n\n## **Why is human resource security important for your organisation?**\n\nBy adopting the framework's principles, organisations may maintain a human\nresources management system that fits their needs and ensures data\navailability, integrity, and confidentiality.\n\nAdditionally, human resource security will prove that you have the ability to:\n\n  * Establish a secure human resources management framework.\n  * Follow the framework and concepts of ISO 27002 in the establishment of human resources security controls in businesses.\n  * Understand the roles and responsibilities of human resources security management components, such as education, training and termination of activities and hiring and recruiting.\n  * Assist a company in the implementation and management of ISO/IEC 27002-based human resources security controls.\n  * Assist organisations in the application of KEY controls before, during, and after the employment of human resources.\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAnnex A.7 of ISO 27001 aims to improve your organisation\u2019s human resource\nmanagement and provide the information security you need with regard to your\nemployees.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.7-human-resource-security/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.7 - Human Resource Security - DataGuard", "description": "Annex A 7 provides guidance to human resource security compliance that is required in InfoSec.

{"page_content": "## What is Annex A.8?\n\nAnnex A.8 is one of the 14 Annex A control sets found in Annex A meant to\nguide the clauses of the ISO 27001 standard. It focuses on Asset Management,\nand outlines the requirements and responsibilities for security practices\nspecific to the type of asset. In general, Annex A.8 refers to four types of\nasset.\n\nTo understand the Asset A.8 controls, let\u2019s first explore what asset\nmanagement is and why it is important.\n\n## What is Asset Management?\n\nIn short, the concept of asset management can be seen when we take inventory\nof IT hardware or maintain access logs.\n\nAsset management is based on the idea that it is important to uphold\naccountability for valuable assets to ensure they are properly protected.\nAccountability includes identifying, tracking, classifying and assigning\nownership to them.\n\n## What are the levels/types of assets?\n\nAssets can be loosely defined as anything an organisation deems valuable, and\nthey can extend beyond physical/tangible objects. There are 4 types of assets\nthat include hardware and software, outsourced services such as mail and chat\nplatforms, and infrastructure that may affect the availability of information.\n\n  * **Human Assets:** Employee skills, level of training, and other values such as loyalty.\n  * **Financial assets:** Cash, stocks, deposits and other liquid assets that may or may not have an inherent worth or physical form.\n  * **Information assets:** Paper or digital documents, passwords and encryption keys, and databases.\n  * **Intangible assets:** Licences, trademarks, certifications and other assets that may affect the reputation of an organisation.\n\nAssets influence each other and the other domains of an organisation, and an\norganisation cannot perform optimally if asset classes operate independently.\nTherefore, assets must be managed in a way that takes these relationships into\naccount.\n\nFor example, the actions and capabilities of employees influence the\nperformance of physical assets. Investments into infrastructure and\nmaintenance services require financial resources. Quality data and information\nare essential for the development, optimisation and implementation of an asset\nmanagement plan. The reputation of an organisation can impact operating\nstrategies and infrastructure investments.\n\nLet's take a look at the requirements outlined in Annex A.8 and what the\nresponsibilities (controls) outlined are and how they must be implemented.\n\n### 1.  Annex A.8.1 - Responsibility of assets\n\nThe objective of Annex A.8.1 is to identify how information assets fit the\nscope of the ISMS, and define the protection responsibilities for these\nassets. Assets may include network equipment and devices, data and\ninformation, IT infrastructure and applications, so these responsibilities\nmust be specific to the type of asset.\n\n  * **A.8.1.1 - Inventory of assets**  \n  \n\nControl: Information assets and facilities should be identified and documented\nin an inventory, along with all activities through its lifecycle.\n\nImplementation: The lifecycle of this information must take into consideration\nits creation, processing, storage, transmission, deletion, and destruction.\nThese activities must be documented in a register or inventory according to\nthe importance of the assets, and then regularly updated, checked for accuracy\nand matched against other inventories.\n\n  * **A.8.1.2 - Ownership of assets**  \n  \n\nControl: All assets must be assigned ownership at the moment of creation.\n\nImplementation: Asset owners may either be individuals, departments or other\nentities. Asset owners must be responsible for the management of assets\nthroughout their lifecycle, but delegation and transference of ownership are\nallowed, as long as documented thoroughly.\n\n  * Asset owners are responsible for:\n\n\n\n    * Proper maintenance of asset inventories\n    * Proper asset classification and security\n    * Reviewing current access management policies and updating them regularly\n    * Proper deletion and destruction of assets\n\n\n\n  * **A.8.1.3 - Acceptable Use of Assets**  \n  \n\nControl: An \u201cAcceptable Use Policy\u201d must be created in consideration of all\nparties who have access to assets.\n\nImplementation: Rules of acceptable use and information security requirements\nmust be made known to all relevant parties who have access to assets, and\nregularly enforced through training and other activities.\n\n  * **A.8.1.4 - Return of Assets**  \n  \n ** **Control:**** Upon termination of a contract or position etc., all\nparties must return any assets to the organisation.\n\nImplementation: Employees and external stakeholders must return all tangible\nand electronic assets in their possession to the organisation in the event\ntheir contract/agreement is terminated. If the equipment used for company\npurposes was purchased by the employee/external party, they must follow\nprotocol to transfer any relevant information to the organisation upon\ntermination.\n\n\n\nReturn of assets must be documented, and non-returns must be logged as\nsecurity incidents unless agreed and documented as part of the exit process.\nThese obligations must be clearly stated in agreements, and regular audits of\nassets are required to ensure their protection.\n\n\n\n### 2\\. Annex A.8.2 - Information Classification\n\nThe objective of A.8.2 is to ensure that information assets receive the\nnecessary protection based on their importance as well as in accordance with\nstakeholder expectations.\n\n  * A.8.2.1 - Classification of information  \n  \n\nControl: Information must be classified to reflect business activity, in terms\nof value, legal requirements, and criteria surrounding unauthorised disclosure\nand modification.\n\nImplementation: Classification must include standards for information sharing\nand restriction. Related, non-information, assets may also fall under such\nclassification. Proper classification is key to ensuring the protection of\ninformation so some organisations may have a few options depending on the\nvalue of the information assets.\n\n\n\nHowever, classification options must be kept simple to meet the right number\nof engineering controls and so as not to confuse users. The effectiveness of\nclassification must be reviewed regularly, and the classification scheme must\nbe kept consistent throughout the organisation.\n\n  * **A.8.2.2 - Labelling of information**  \n  \n ** **Control:**** Procedures for labelling must be developed in accordance\nwith the organisation\u2019s classification scheme established in A.8.2.1.  \n **Implementation:** These procedures must be made available in physical and\nelectronic formats. Labelling must be easily recognisable, documented and made\navailable to all staff to ensure that they are properly followed. Statements\nof confidentiality must be expressly stated and labelled.\n\n  * **A.8.2.3 - Handling of assets**  \n  \n\nControl: Procedures for the proper handling of assets must be developed in\naccordance with the classification scheme established in A.8.2.1.\n\nImplementation: These procedures must cover the handling, processing, storing,\nand communication of classified information.\n\n\n\nThe following must be considered:\n\n    * Access restrictions proportionate to the classification level\n    * A formal record of approved asset recipients\n    * Security of an appropriate level\n    * Manufacturer-specified storage procedures for IT assets\n    * Clearly marked recipient details on all versions/copies of the media\n\nIt may be required to produce a mapping policy to show customers/suppliers\netc. that their information assets are being protected.\n\n### 3\\. Annex A.8.3 \\- Media Handling\n\nThe objective of this annex is to prevent the unauthorised disclosure,\nmodification, removal or destruction of information assets stored on media.\n\n  * A.8.3.1 \\- Management of removable media  \n  \n\nControl: Procedures for the management of removable media must be implemented\nin accordance with the classification scheme established in A.8.2.1.\n\nImplementation: Media must only be made removable if justified by a business\nreason, and must be made unrecoverable when no longer required. The general\nuse of removable media must be risk assessed, and its removal must be recorded\nand require authorisation.\n\n\n\nWhen necessary, added security measures, such as cryptographic keys, must be\napplied. Media should be stored according to manufacturer specifications, and\ncopies should be stored across different formats to prevent total accidental\nloss or damage.\n\n  * **A.8.3.2** \\- **Disposal of media**  \n  \n **Control:** Media must be disposed of in accordance with documented\nprocedures, once no longer required.  \n **Implementation:** Procedures for the disposal of media are required to\nprevent the unauthorised leakage of confidential information. These procedures\nmust depend on the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information in\nquestion.  \n  \nConfidential media must be disposed of through physical means such as\nshredding or incineration, or through data erasure. Assets which require\nsecure disposal must be identified. Data disposal must be logged to maintain\nan audit trail, and it is best to dispose of media collectively, in one go.  \n\n  * **A.8.3.3** \\- **Physical media transfer**  \n  \n **Control:** Media containing information assets must be protected during\ntransportation unless already publicly available.  \n **Implementation:** Reliable couriers should be agreed upon with management,\nprotective packaging must be used to prevent physical damage, and all\ntransport activities should be logged. Logs must include security measures\napplied, transfer times and details of custodians. Extra care must be taken in\nthe case of unencrypted media.  \n  \n\n## What are the other Annex A control categories?\n\nThe other 13 categories of Annex A controls cover other domains of an\norganisation that require management for the protection of information assets:\n\n  * A.5 - Information Security Policies\n  * A.6 - Organisation of Information Security\n  * A.7 - Human Resources Security\n  * A.9 - Access Control\n  * A.10 - Cryptography\n  * A.11 - Physical and Environmental Security\n  * A.12 - Operational Security\n  * A.13 - Communications Security\n  * A.14 - Systems Acquisition, Development and Maintenance\n  * A.15 - Supplier Relationships\n  * A.16 - Information Security Incident Management\n  * A.17 - Information Security aspects of Business Continuity Management\n  * A.18 - Compliance\n\nWhen combined, Annex A can be used as a list of ISO 27001 controls, and while\nnot mandatory, organisations should identify and implement controls that best\nalign with stakeholder expectations of information security.\n\nAchieving ISO 27001 compliance includes many policies and guidelines, as well\nas several documents that may make the compliance process seem daunting to\nthose who are unfamiliar. Read our comprehensive guide to ISO 27001\nrequirements  to find out what you need to get started.\n\n## How do you build an Asset Inventory?\n\nIt is vital to know which assets your organisation possesses, who is\nresponsible for their management and how they must be handled.\n\nBuilding an asset inventory is best done during the risk assessment process of\nimplementing your ISMS, using a \u201cdescribe what you see\u201d approach to take all\nassets in use into account. This includes all softwares installed and physical\nstorage (cabinets etc) tied to the information in question.\n\nConsider including the following information in your asset inventory:\n\n  * Asset name\n  * Asset ownership\n  * Asset category\n  * Asset location\n  * Any relevant notes\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt is important to take time to identify which information assets require\nprotection and how they fit into the scope of your organisation\u2019s ISMS.\nListing assets helps you and your organisation identify what is of value and\nin need of protection.\n\nA.8 and the other Annex A control sets are vital to the proper protection of\nyour organisation\u2019s information assets, and, though not mandatory, help you\nalign your information security practices with the ISO 27001 framework.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.8-asset-management", "title": "ISO 27001 Controls: Annex A.8 Asset Management - DataGuard", "description": "Annex A.8 covers Asset Management .

{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A.9?**\n\nAnnex A.9 access control guarantees that only authorised users have access to\na service, while unauthorised individuals are barred from using it.\n\nAccess control is often referred to by the terms \u201caccess management\u201d, \u201crights\nmanagement\u201d, and \u201cidentity management\u201d. Unauthorised people may get access to\ninformation assets and information processing facilities, resulting in\ninformation misuse or loss. The access control clause tackles these issues by\nallowing you to control who has access to these assets.\n\nInformation asset protection is critical for all organisations, and Annex A.9\nprotects against a variety of risks, including unintentional damage or loss of\ninformation, overheating, threats, and so on. This requires a defined control\npolicy and processes, as well as the registration, removal, and review of user\naccess rights\u2014includes physical access, network access, control over\nprivileged utilities, and limitation of access to programme source code.\n\n## **What is access control?**\n\nAn important aspect of information security is determining who can access and\nuse company information. Access control policies ensure that users are who\nthey claim to be and that they have proper access to organisation data through\nauthentication and authorisation. Physical access to buildings, rooms, and\ndata centers can also be restricted with the use of access control.\n\nPasswords, usernames, PINs, biometrics, and other types of security tokens can\nall be used to identify a user in an access control system. Multi Factor\nAuthentication (MFA) is a common feature of many access control systems,\nrequiring various forms of identification to authenticate a user.\n\nIn the event that a user's credentials and IP address have been validated, the\nappropriate level of access and allowed actions can then be granted to that\nuser.\n\nAccess control can be divided into four categories. When it comes to security\nand compliance, organisations tend to adopt the method that makes the most\nsense for their own needs. The four types of access control are as follows:\n\n  * **Discretionary access control (DAC)** \\- In DAC, the person who owns or manages the protected system, data, or resource decides who has permission to access it.\n\n  * **Mandatory access control (MAC)** -  In this non-discretionary model, users are permitted access based on a clearance of information. Access privileges are regulated by a central authority depending on varying levels of security. Typically, it is used in government and military settings.\n\n  * **Role-based access control (RBAC)** -  Instead of granting access based on a user's identification, RBAC offers access based on predefined business functions. Users should only have access to information that is relevant to their jobs in the organisation. Roles, authorisations, and permissions make up the foundation of this commonly used approach.\n\n    * **Attribute-based access control (ABAC)** -  With ABAC, both people and resources can have their access controlled according to a dynamic set of qualities and environmental variables, such as what time of day it is and where they are.\n\n\n\n## **What are the Annex A.9 controls?**\n\n### **Annex A.9.1: Business requirements of access control**\n\nThis clause's goal is to set up and put in place procedures that restrict who\nhas access to information and information processing facilities. Access\ncontrol policies must be developed in order to comply with this regulation.\n\n#### **A.9.1.1: Access control policy**\n\nEstablishing, documenting, and periodically reviewing an access control policy\nwith accompanying business and information security requirements is a must. To\nprotect their assets, asset owners should set suitable access control, access\nrights and user role constraints, with the volume of information and the\nstrictness of controls reflecting the associated information security risks.\n\nWhen considering access controls, it is important to consider both their\nreason and value. There should be a clear declaration of the business\nrequirements that access controls should meet for users and service providers.\n\n### **A.9.1.2 Access to networks and network services**\n\nThe network and network services that are necessary for the user's employment\nshould be restricted to those who need access to them.\n\nPolicy must address: networks and network services in scope for access;\nauthorisation procedures for indicating who (role-based) is permitted to\naccess what and when; and management control to prevent or monitor access in\nthe real world. Onboarding and off-boarding procedures should take this into\naccount, as well as the access control policy as a whole.\n\n### **Annex A.9.2: User access management  **\n\nThe objective of this clause is to ensure that your authorised users can\naccess your system and services and at the same time prevent unauthorised\naccess.\n\n#### **A.9.2.1 User registration and deregistration**\n\nUser registration and deregistration must be made official. The ability to\nlink specific IDs to real persons and limit shared access IDs should be part\nof a solid user ID management procedure, which should be approved and recorded\nwhen done.\n\nWith Annex A.7 Human Resource Security as a link, a smooth registration and\nderegistration process is possible, as is the avoidance of granting duplicate\nIDs. To demonstrate strong control and to reinforce continuous management, IDs\nshould be reviewed on a regular basis. Access control audits and periodic\nevaluations by the owners of information assets or processing applications can\nbe used in conjunction with this.\n\n#### **A.9.2.2 User access provisioning  **\n\nInformation system or service owners should grant or revoke access to their\nsystems or services according to this process. By ensuring that the access\ngiven is relevant to the function being performed, provisioning can be avoided\nbefore authorisation is complete.\n\nIt is crucial that user access is business-driven and tailored to the needs of\nthe organisation. However, this may sound bureaucratic, but it does not have\nto be, and effective basic procedures with role-based access can address this.\n\n#### **A.9.2.3 Management of privileged access rights**\n\nSpecial access to data and systems requires strict controls on who gets it and\nhow it's used because of the additional power it gives the person who has it.\nSystem by system clarity on privileged access permissions (which can be\nmodified within the programme) could fall under this category, as well as\nallocation based on actual usage rather than a blanket policy.\n\nAll privileges issued to users should be documented, and the competency of\nthose users granted the permissions must be constantly evaluated to ensure\nthat they are able to perform their assigned responsibilities.\n\nIt's also a good idea to keep separate identities for system administrators\nand regular users, especially if they're doing various jobs on the same\nplatform.\n\n#### **A.9.2.4 Management of secret authentication information of users**\n\nAccess to important assets is being granted through the use of secret\nauthentication information. When it comes to sensitive information like\npasswords or encryption keys, it needs to be managed through a structured\nprocess and kept private to its user.\n\nThe user's identity should be verified prior to supplying any new,\nreplacement, or temporary secret authentication information. When a new system\nis set up, any default secret authentication information should be altered as\nquickly as possible.\n\n#### **A.9.2.5 Review of user access rights**\n\nOwners of assets must conduct periodic audits of user access rights, both for\nindividual changes (such as onboarding, role changes, and departures) and for\nlarger audits of system access.\n\nIt is essential that privileged access permissions be assessed more frequently\nbecause of their high-risk nature. Internal audits, such as this one, should\nbe conducted at least once a year, or more frequently if significant changes\noccur.\n\n#### **A.9.2.6 Removal or adjustment of access rights**\n\nAll access rights to information and information processing facilities must be\nrevoked following termination of employment, contract, or agreement, as\nspecified in the preceding paragraph (or adjusted upon change of role if\nrequired).\n\nWhen employees leave, an effective exit policy and procedures that tie in with\nA.7 will help guarantee that this goal is met and can be verified for audit\npurposes.\n\n### **Annex A.9.3: User responsibilities  **\n\nThe purpose here is to hold users accountable for ensuring that their\nauthentication information is not compromised. This technique requires your\nstaff to follow the instructions for using the secret authentication\ncredentials.\n\n#### **A.9.3.1 Use of secret authentication information**\n\nSecret authentication information should be kept private; unauthorised\nindividuals should not have access to it; and, if there is any indication that\nit may have been compromised, the information should be changed immediately.\n\nAdditionally, you should encourage users to choose strong passwords that meet\nthe minimal requirements in Annex A.9.4 for password length and strength.\n\n### **Annex A.9.4: System and application access control  **\n\nThe goal of this sub clause is to have systems in place to prevent unwanted\naccess to your information systems and applications.\n\n#### **A.9.4.1 Information access restriction**\n\nThe use of information and application system functionalities should be\nregulated according to the company's access control policy. Control on access\nshould be applied complying to the stated access control policy and based on\nbusiness application requirements. To access restriction standards, keep in\nmind the following:\n\n  * Controlling access to application system functionalities through menus.\n  * Limiting the data that a specific user has access to.\n  * User access privileges, such as read, write, delete, and execute control.\n  * controlling other applications' access rights.\n  * Reducing the amount of data in outputs.\n  * Physical or logical access control to isolate sensitive applications, application data, and systems from the rest of the network.\n\n#### **A.9.4.2 Secure log-on procedures**\n\nThe user must be able to authenticate their identity through a secure log-on\nprocedure before they may access systems and apps. Multi-factor\nauthentication, biometrics, smart cards, and other forms of encryption can be\nused in place of passwords, depending on the risk.\n\nAuthentication information should be transmitted and stored in encrypted form\nto prevent interception and misuse of the information.\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), as well as the ISO 27002\nguidelines, are significant in this area. Here are a few more pointers:\n\n  * In order to avoid interception and misuse, log-on methods should be built in a way they cannot be easily avoided.\n  * There should also be a warning that access is restricted to those who are authorised. Legislation like the Computer Misuse Act of 1990 is intended to be supported by this (UK).\n  * In order to offer forensic evidence, both successful and unsuccessful log-ons and log-offs should be recorded securely, and notifications for failed attempts and suspected lock-outs should be considered.\n  * Depending on the system, access may need to be restricted to specific hours of the day or days, or even to specific locations.\n  * When it comes to log on and log off protocols, the demands of the business and the information at risk should be the primary considerations. If personnel are unable to do their work well and spend a disproportionate amount of time in this loop, having 25 steps to log on, rapid timeouts, etc. It is simply disproportional.\n\n#### **A.9.4.3 Password management system**\n\nThis helps prevent the same login from being used across several sites by\nproviding a centralised method for password generation and administration.\n\nThe implementation of password generation and management systems must be done\nwith care, as with any other control mechanism, to provide acceptable and\nproportionate levels of security. Passwords should be created by the user\nwhenever possible, but they must meet a particular level of security in order\nto be secure enough for the user to remember them without difficulty.\n\n#### **A.9.4.4 Use of privileged utility programmes**\n\nControls on the system and applications should be carefully monitored for\nutility computer programmes that have the potential to override them.\n\nMalicious attackers may take advantage of powerful system and network utility\nprogrammes, thus only a small number of users should have access to them.\n\nUsers should be limited in their capacity to install any software as much as\npossible considering company requirements and risk assessment while using such\nreadily available utility programmes from the internet. To meet auditor\nrequirements, the use of utility programmes should be documented and\nmonitored/reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n#### **A.9.4.5 Access control to program source code**\n\nRestrictions must be placed on access to the program's source code. There\nshould be strong controls on who has access to programme source code and\nrelated materials (such as designs, specifications, verification plans, and\nvalidation plans).\n\nIf a program's source code is not appropriately safeguarded, an attacker has a\nstrong opportunity to gain access to the system in a covert manner. This is\nespecially true if the source code is critical to the company's success.\n\n##  \n\n## **Why is access control important for your organisation?**\n\nProtecting sensitive data such as personal identifying information and\nintellectual property is a primary goal of access control. As part of the\ncontemporary zero-trust security framework, it's a critical part of ensuring\nthat only authorised users have access to a firm network. Organisations are at\nrisk of data leakage from both internal and external sources if they don't\nhave strong access control procedures.\n\nControlling access to resources, apps, and data in both on-premises and cloud\nenvironments is critical for enterprises using hybrid or multi-cloud cloud\narchitectures. Single sign-on (SSO) and, access management can protect these\nenvironments from unmanaged access and BYO policy (Bring Your Own) can also\nrestrict access to certain resources and apps.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAnnex A.9 is one of the most important clauses to implement when getting ISO\n27001 certified. The security of your information is important, and one of the\nmain ways to keep it secure is to control access to this information. Setting\naccess controls helps prevent unwanted access, attacks on information systems\nand data leaks.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.9-access-control/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.9 - Access Control - DataGuard", "description": "Annex A.9, one of the most important clauses of Annex A, will provide a deeper understanding of access control and why it is important.

{"page_content": "## **What is Cryptography in information security?**\n\nIn its textbook definition, cryptography is a term that refers to secure\ninformation and communication techniques that use mathematical concepts and a\nset of rule-based calculations known as algorithms to convert messages into\ndifficult-to-decipher formats.\n\nEssentially, this means that it is used as a safe way for a sender and\nrecipient to communicate without an outside party to hacking and reading its\ncontents.\n\nThe following four goals are covered by modern cryptography:\n\n  * **Confidentiality  **  \nAnyone who was not supposed to receive the data is most likely unable to\ninterpret it.\n\n  * **Integrity  **  \nThe information cannot be tampered with either in storage or in transit\nbetween the sender and the intended recipient without being noticed.\n\n  * **Non-repudiation  **  \nThe information originator cannot later deny or dispute their intentions in\nthe development or transmission of the data.\n\n  * **Authentication**  \nThe sender and recipient may verify each other's identities as well as the\ninformation's origin and destination.\n\nIn Information Security, cryptography is closely linked to encryption, which\nis the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext and then back again\nwhen it is received. Encrypting and decrypting email and other plain-text\nmessages are the most typical usage of cryptography when moving data.\n\n## **How does cryptography and encryption work together?**\n\nIn information technology, cryptography is generally series of numbers and\nletters in plaintext that are stored in a file often referred to as a \"key\".\n\nThe symmetric-key or \"secret key\" is an algorithm used for encryption and\ndecryption. The encoded message and secret key are then delivered to the\nreceiver for decoding.\n\nHowever, if the data is intercepted, a third party has all they need to decode\nand read it. To solve this problem, cryptologists created the asymmetric or\n\"public key\". Encryption through public key cryptography offers its users with\ntwo keys, one private key and the public key is  avaialable to anyone to use.\n\nAfter receiving the recipient's public key, senders encrypt the message and\nsend it along to the recipient. Once the message arrives, only the recipient's\nprivate key can decode it, therefore theft is pointless without the matching\nprivate key on the receiving end.\n\n## **What is Annex A.10?**\n\nAnnex A.10 is how cryptography should be handled in your organisation on your\njourney to information security compliance. When handling data in your\norganisation, it includes sensitive organisational data, your employee's data\nand your customer's data.\n\nWhether your customers are individuals or businesses, you store and transmit\ntheir private data within your organisation including but not limited to\npersonal data such as location, financial information, medical records,\nrevenue/income, etc.\n\nThe two controls under Annex A.10 that help your organisation implement\ncryptography in your organisation are:\n\n  * **Policy on the use of Cryptographic Controls**\n  * **Key Management**\n\nNext, let us take a look at the objective of Annex A.10 to start implementing\nISO 27001 on your journey to achieve overall information security compliance\nfor your organisation.\n\n## **What is the objective of Annex A.10?**\n\nAnnex A.10 is a part of the Annex A controls of the ISO 27001 certification.\nOnce you start your compliance journey you must select which controls apply to\nyour organisation.\n\nThe main objective of Annex A.10s is to assure that cryptography is used\ncorrectly and efficiently to safeguard information's privacy, authenticity,\nand integrity. It also helps your organisation build overall strong\ninformation security practices covering a wide area of encryption as it is an\nimportant part of the ISMS (information security management system).\n\n\n\n## **What are the Annex A.10 cryptography controls?**\n\nWhether the information being protected is stored and at rest or being\ntransmitted during communication, in ISO 27001, cryptographic controls are\ndefined as security practices tailored toward proper and effective use of\ncryptography to protect information, according to perceived risks.\n\n  * **A.10.1.1 Policy on the use of Cryptographic Controls**  \n  \n\n\n\nConducting a risk assessment for your organisation could help speed up its\nencryption process by helping you understand and identify risks and\nopportunities to focus on.\n\nA risk assessment comes in handy when identifying corrupt or missing keys\nwhich allow you to navigate those risks and increase information security\nduring ISO 27001 implementation.\n\n  * ### **A.10.1.2: Key Management**\n\nThe essential components of encryption are cryptographic keys. Without them,\nencryption's entire purpose is lost. The use of cryptographic techniques\nshould be in line with the organisation's best practices and information\nsecurity policy.\n\n\n\nCryptographic keys are all part of proper key management and provide safe\nmechanisms for:\n\n    * Creating keys\n    * Processing keys\n    * Archiving keys\n    * Retrieving keys\n    * Transferring keys\n    * Deleting keys\n    * Destroying keys\n\nPhysical environmental security should also be considered for the equipment\nused to generate, process, and archive keys.\n\n  \nA key management framework should be built around a collection of agreed-upon\nconcepts, protocols, and procedures for generating keys for various\ncryptographic algorithms and applications. They are:\n\n  * Creating a public key certificate\n  * Distribute keys to designated entities, with the keys activated upon reception. \n  * Keeping track of keys, as well as who has access to them\n  * Keys that need to be adjusted or upgraded; keys that are missing\n  * Keys that have been revoked, as well as how they may be removed or disabled\n  * Keys that have gone missing or have been corrupted can be recovered\n  * Keys for backup or archiving\n  * Destruction of keys\n  * Key managerial activities are logged and audited\n\n## **Why is Cryptography important for your organisation's information\nsecurity management?**\n\nCryptography is used to secure transactions and communications, protect\npersonal information, verify identity, prevent document manipulation, and\nbuild trust between servers as the basis of advanced security systems.\n\nCryptography is one of the most important methods used by organisations to\nsafeguard the systems that store their most valuable data.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAnnex A.10 Cryptography is important for ISO 27001 implementation in your\norganisation since the certification helps you demonstrate excellent security\nprocedures and gives you a competitive advantage.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.10-cryptography", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.10 - Cryptography - DataGuard", "description": "Learn about the cryptography specific Annex,its objectives, controls, and how this Annex can benefit your organisation in its information security journey.", "language": "en-gb"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "## What is Annex A 11?\n\nAnnex A 11 is the physical and environmental security of your organisation.\nSometimes, organisations may be under the impression that data breaches,\nlosses and cyber threats could only occur via technology. However, Annex A 11\nof ISO 27001 brings light upon the physical landscape of the organisation that\notherwise may be overlooked.\n\nAnnex A 11 covers a range of controls that define and protect organisations\nfrom incidences that may occur in the physical landscape of an organisation,\nsuch as:\n\n  * **Natural disasters**\n  * **Theft**\n  * **Intentional destruction**\n  * **Unintentional destruction**\n  * **hardware failures**\n  * **Power failures**\n\nInstances such as theft and intentional destruction may occur due to\nunauthorised access, careless handling of records, improper disposal of\nrecords, etc.\n\nThese incidents can be prevented and avoided if adequate physical security\nmeasures are taken timely and the physical environment of the organisation is\ninspected frequently for its functionality.\n\nThere are two main controls under Annex A 11 that define the main reasons why\nit must be implemented in an organisation.\n\n\n## What is the objective of Annex A 11?\n\nEach of the two main controls under Annex A 11 have similar but different\nobjectives.\n\nThe two main controls are: A.11.1 Secure areas and A.11.2 Equipment.\n\n### **Objective of   A.11.1 Secure areas**\n\nPhysical and environmental security are at the core of Annex A.11.1. The\nobjective of this control is to prevent unauthorised physical access and\ndamage to the organisation's stored data.\n\n### **Objective of A.11.2 Equipment**\n\nEquipment is equally important as secure areas of Annex A.11.2. The objective\nof this control is to avoid asset loss, damage and or theft as well as\ndisruption of business activities.\n\n\n## What is physical and environmental security?\n\nPhysical and environmental security refers to the precautions put in place to\nprotect systems, buildings, and supporting equipment against physical threats.\nIt refers to the protection of people's data, property data, and physical\nasset data against physical threats such as natural disasters, theft, and\nintentional destruction.\n\nPhysical and environmental security, according to ISO 27001, are sometimes\noverlooked yet remain critical in safeguarding information.\n\nThere are three principles that organisations must follow when it comes to\nphysical and environmental security. They are: physical deterrence, detection\nof intruders, and response to those risks.\n\n\n\n## What are the Annex A 11 controls?\n\n### **A.11.1.1 Physical Security Perimeter**\n\nSecurity perimeters, as well as each parameter's location, must be provided.\nYour organisation can use the risk assessment results, as well as the security\nneeds of the assets within the perimeter, should be used to decide this.\n\nISO 27001 defines a physical security perimeter as \"any transition barrier\nbetween two locations with varying security protection demands.\" Therefore,\nemployees who work from home or an office may all have access to data that is\ndesignated as part of your physical security perimeter.\n\n### **A.11.1.2 Physical Entry Controls**\n\nOnce you have established physical security perimeters, you are required to\ninstall entry controls to manage who may move between secure areas of the\npremises.\n\nHandheld metal detectors, walk-through metal detectors, swipe cards, and\nkeycodes are all options for gaining access to different areas of your\norganisation. Different degrees of protection might be used in different\nsections of your organisation. The approach you take to build and administer\nsecurity restrictions should align with the significance of the data you are\nstoring.\n\n### **A.11.1.3 Securing Offices, Rooms and Facilities**\n\nAnnex A 11 focuses on an organisation's physical environment security (which\nmeans it does not just monitor the data it holds), but also focuses on\nsafeguarding where that data is stored.\n\nEquipment containing sensitive information is kept in various rooms, offices,\nand facilities, and these locations may not be as secure as we believe. Even\nthough the information contained on these devices is of lesser importance, any\ntype of unauthorised access is harmful to the organisation.\n\nFirstly, organisations must identify the equipment stored in these spaces and\nthe types of data stored in them. Then they must grade the importance of each\ntype of data set found on each device and implement security controls\naccordingly.\n\n### **A.11.1.4 Protecting against External & Environmental Threats**\n\nThis control is about how natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes,\ntsunamis, snowfall, and floods may damage an organisation's physical premises.\nThis component is purely dependent on natural occurrences that might result in\ninfrastructure damage and the loss of data storage devices like files, hard\ndrives, and pen drives.\n\nThe key to preventing your organisation from being damaged in such scenarios\nis to analyse the environment in which it operates and detect macro and micro\nexternal threats.\n\nFollowing the analysis of these possibilities, it is recommended that your\norganisation take the required steps and measures to protect the physical\npremises of your organisation so that natural occurrences cause little to no\nharm on the premises.\n\n### **A.11.1.5 Working in Secure Areas**\n\nCertain operations that must be completed inside an organisation may be\nrestricted to senior employees alone. As a result, your company may need to\nisolate this type of work from the rest of the workforce and have it done in\nan undisclosed location.\n\nAny suspicious behaviour carried out by internal and external unauthorised\naccess can be detected using surveillance cameras and screen monitors.\n\n### **A.11.1.6 Delivery & Loading Areas**\n\nThis control is not limited to businesses in the manufacturing industry. Even\nif you're a service provider, you may almost certainly have one or more\ndelivery and loading areas on your premises.\n\nThis area/areas might be utilised to unload new electronic gadgets, furniture,\nfood, and other items that your company might purchase. Unauthorised persons\ncan exploit this area/areas as a swift entry point into the premises, placing\nyour organisation's physical and environmental safety at risk.\n\nYour organisation must identify delivery and loading entry points and add\nsecurity personnel, surveillance cameras, and a staff member to monitor the\nunloading and loading of items within the premises.\n\nIf your company is housed in a shared workplace, such as a coworking space,\nyou may be restricted to the security measures available at the point of\nentry. However, there should always be someone in the office who can\nimmediately spot any suspicious conduct and take appropriate action before it\noccurs.\n\n\n# **Why is physical and environmental security important for your\norganisation?**\n\nAn organisation requires administrative, technological and physical control in\norder to carry out business operations smoothly. While it is important that an\norganisation's digital assets and systems infrastructure are protected,\norganisations must also protect its physical environment, which includes but\nis not limited to:\n\n  * Offices, rooms and facilities\n  * Delivery and loading areas\n  * Entry and exit points of buildings\n  * Physical data storage devices such as computers, hard drives and pen drives.\n\nPaying attention to and protecting these physical components of the\norganisation will help improve overall information security implementation.\nThis will help protect existing and new data sets of employees and customers\nthat flow into the organisation.\n\nProtecting your organisation's physical security's primary goal is to protect\nthe company's most precious asset: its employees and customers.\n\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nAnnex A 11 is one of the 114 controls in ISO 27001 that organisations can\nchoose to adopt as part of their information security procedures. Physical\nsecurity, on the other hand, is advised to be chosen as one of those controls\nand should be prioritised since it protects your company from physical data\nbreaches in the long run.\n\nAnnex A 11 and other controls are all important for your organisation's ISO\n27001 implementation. ISO 27001 certification not only helps you showcase\nstrong security procedures, but it also gives you a competitive edge over your\ncompetitors.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.11-physical-and-environmental-security/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.11 - physical and environmental security", "description": "Annex A 11 helps implement the physical environmental security of an organisation.

{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A.12?**\n\nAnnex A.12 of the Annex A Controls sets out guidelines for the secure\nmanagement and control of your information processing operations. Proper\nalignment with Annex A.12 is essential to prevent the loss or unauthorised\ntransmission of valuable information, and ensure its confidentiality and\nintegrity.\n\nAs with the other Annex A controls, implementation isn\u2019t mandatory, but\nchoosing the right controls following a risk assessment is essential to\nachieving ISO 27001 compliance.\n\nLet\u2019s understand what Annex A.12 entails, and what its requirements for\noperations security are.\n\n## What is Operations Security?\n\nOperations security, or OPSEC, is the process of protecting valuable\ninformation assets from leaks, loss and damage. It is an important part of\nrisk management, where we identify opportunities for data loss or theft and\nwork to minimise these risks. With good OPSEC controls in place, you can lay\nout a framework of best practices and guidelines on how best to protect\nvaluable information.  \n\nThere are multiple reasons why operations security is important to an\norganisation\u2019s infosec framework, which we will explore in more detail.\n\n## **Why is Operations Security important for your Organisation?**\n\nOPSEC practices push organisations to assess, identify and mitigate potential\ninfosec risks to stay protected against hacking attempts and malware programs.\n\nEffective OPSEC ensures confidential information isn\u2019t intentionally or\nunintentionally exposed, and also guides how the organisation may respond in\nthe event of a compromise. Information leaks can be potentially devastating\nfor an organisation, with hackers gaining access to sensitive information such\nas financial records and personnel data. Therefore, it is exceedingly\nimportant to maintain strong OPSEC policies.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at the requirements of Annex A.12 and how they\ncontribute to a holistic OPSEC program.\n\n## **What are the Annex A.12 controls?**\n\nAnnex A.12 consists of a list of 14 controls across seven key aspects of\noperations security. In this section let\u2019s look at how each of these controls\ncontribute to good OPSEC practices, and how they can be implemented.\n\n### **1\\. Annex A.12.1 - Operational procedures and responsibilities**\n\nThe objective of A.12.1 is to ensure that information processing facilities\nare being operated in  a secure and proper manner. This set of controls\noutlines the standards that any data processing group must follow.\n\n  * **A.12.1.1 - Documented operating procedures**  \n  \n **Control: **All organisational operating procedures must be documented and\nmade available to personnel and relevant stakeholders.  \nImplementation: Such documentation ensures uniformity and ease of access in\nthe event of system changes (staff and resources) or disaster management.\nDocuments should be kept updated, and records should be maintained in a way\nthat makes sense for your organisation, taking into account its growth and\nstability. Be sure to document processes related to the at-risk areas\nidentified during risk assessment.  \nThe following should be considered:\n\n  * Systems installation and settings\n  * Automated and manual processing and management of information\n  * Regular back ups\n  * Early work starts and latest job completion times, including reliance on other systems for the same\n  * Instructions for handling errors or any systems restrictions that may arise during job execution\n  * Contacts details of support bodies in the event of operational or technical issues\n  * Specific handling instructions, including that of failed work\n  * System reboot and recovery procedures in the event of system failures\n  * Audit-trail management and system log information\n  * Monitoring procedures  \n  \n\n  * **A.12.1.2 - Change management**    \n  \n\nControl: Organisational changes, including changes to infosec systems, must be\ncontrolled.\n\nImplementation: Change management ensures that there is minimal opportunity\nfor the accidental or intentional compromisation or loss of data. Change\nmanagement should be applied across the organisation. This includes all of its\nprocesses, and facilities that handle the processing of information, such as\nnetworks, systems, and applications. Change procedures should be recorded in\naudit logs in a level of detail that is consistent with the nature of the\nchanges being recorded.\n\n  \n\nThe following should be considered:\n\n\n\n    * Record significant changes\n    * Plan and test modifications\n    * Record the possible impacts of changes\n    * Record a formal approval process for proposed changes\n    * Verify compliance with infosec requirements\n    * Communicate changes to all relevant individuals \n    * Record any failure to recover costs and the effect of unforeseeable incidents\n    * An emergency procedure for resolving unforeseeable incidents quickly and in a controlled manner\n\n  * **Annex A.12.1.3 Capacity management**  \n  \n\nControl: Resource usage must be monitored, adapted, and projected to ensure\noptimal system performance in line with your organisation\u2019s objectives.\n\nImplementation: Consider data storage capacity, processing power capacity and\ncommunications capacity, and ensure that capacity management is proactive and\nreactive, so the system operates within its capabilities.\n\n  \n\nSome examples of capacity management requirements are:\n\n\n\n    * Freeing up disk space by removing obsolete data\n    * Decommissioning application, programs, databases or environment\n    * Restricting bandwidth to business-critical usage\n\n  * **Annex A.12.1.4 - Separation of development, testing & operational Environments**  \n  \n\nControl: Keep development, testing and operational environments separate to\nprevent unauthorised access and changes to the operational environment.\n\nImplementation: Separating duties by keeping environments separate ensures the\nsafety of live data. Testing should be carried out in a separate environment,\nand authorisation should be required for the transference of data across\nenvironments.\n\n### 2\\. **Annex A.12.2 - Protection from malware**\n\nThe objective of A.12.2 is to protect your information from malware. A.12.2\nhas only one requirement.\n\n  * **A.12.2.1 - Controls against malware**  \n  \n ** **Control:**** Protective measures must be implemented that ensure the\ndetection of, protection from, and recovery from malware attacks.  \n ** **Implementation:**** Restricting removable media and addressing potential\nrisks is necessary, in addition to keeping your systems and software up to\ndate. Malware detection and repair software is essential to A.12.2.\n\n### 3\\. **Annex A.12.3 - Information backup**\n\nThe objective of A.12.3 is to ensure protection against the loss of valuable\ninformation.\n\n  * **Annex A.12.3.1 - Information backup**  \n  \n **Control:** Backup copies of information must be maintained and tested\nregularly.  \n **Implementation:** Backup guidelines/policies must consider risk levels and\nyour organisation\u2019s needs. Backup data must be stored away from the live\nenvironment to ensure no data is not compromised.  \n\n### 4\\. **Annex A.12.4 - Logging and Monitoring**\n\nThe objective of A.12.4 is to log and generate evidence.\n\n  * **Annex A.12.4.1 - Event logging**  \n  \n\nControl: All event logs must contain organisational information such as user\ndata, infosec events and flaws.\n\nThe following must be considered:\n\n  * User IDs\n  * System activities (dates, times and details of key events)\n  * Device identity or location\n  * System access attempts\n  * Resource access attempts\n  * Changes to system con\ufb01guration\n  * Use of privileges\n  * Use of system utilities and applications\n  * Files accessed and the type of access\n  * Network addresses and protocols\n  * Access control system alarms \n  * Activation and deactivation of protection systems\n  * In-app transaction records  \n  \n\n  * **Annex A.12.4.2 - Protection of log information**  \n  \n **Control:** Logs must be maintained to prevent unauthorised tampering.  \n\nImplementation: These logs must be stored in a safe and secure manner to\nensure they are not tampered with.\n\n  * **Annex A.12.4.3 - Administrator and operator software**  \n  \n **Control:** Logs of system operators and administrators must be maintained\nand regularly updated.  \n **Implementation:** Accounts with stricter logging requirements must be\nprioritised.\n\n  * **Annex A.12.4.4 - Clock synchronisation**  \n  \n **Control:** Clocks of all information processing systems must be\nsynchronised to a single source.  \n **Implementation:** Correct synchronisation is necessary to prove \u201ccause and\neffect\u201d and provide evidence of events.  \n  \n\n### 5\\. Annex A.12.5 - Control of operational software\n\nThe objective of A.12.5 is to ensure the integrity of operational systems.\n\n  * **Annex A.12.5.1 - Installation of software on operational Systems**  \n  \n **Control:** The installation of software must be formally controlled by\nimplementing procedures.  \n **Implementation:** Formal procedures such as change management, proper\nassignment of responsibility, roll-back policies and histories must be\nmaintained.  \n\nThe following must be considered:\n\n  * Management permissions to upgrade software \n  * Only approved code should exist in operating systems\n  * User-friendly testing functions\n  * Regularly updated program source libraries\n\n### 6\\. Annex A.12.6 - Technical vulnerability management\n\nThe objective of A.12.6 is to avoid the exploitation of technical\nvulnerabilities.\n\n  * **Annex A.12.6.1 - Management of technical vulnerabilities**  \n  \n\nControl: All vulnerabilities of information systems must be evaluated and\naddressed through proper measures.\n\nImplementation: Formal measures must be appropriate and adequate. A\ncommunication strategy to update users about vulnerabilities can be useful to\nfacilitate risk management through user behaviours.\n\n****  \n****\n\nThe following must be considered:\n\n\n\n    * Network firewalls\n    * Enhanced surveillance\n    * Increase vulnerability awareness\n  * **Annex A.12.6.2 - Restrictions on software installations**  \n  \n\nControl: Strict rules are needed to restrict which software users are allowed\nto install on organisational equipment.\n\nImplementation: These rules must also restrict the ability of individuals to\ninstall software on organisational equipment, as it introduces the threat of\nmalware. If total restriction is not an option, a white list of allowed\nsoftware can be compiled.\n\n### 7\\. Annex A.12.7 - Information Systems and audit considerations\n\nThe objective of A.12.7 is to minimise the impact of audits and related\nactivities on daily operations and operational systems.\n\n  * **Annex A.12.7.1 - Information Systems audit controls**  \n  \n\nControl: All audit requirements, such as access to systems, must be pre-\nplanned and negotiated with management so audit processes cause minimal\ndisruption to business operations.\n\nImplementation: The scope and depth of audits and systems testing must be\nclearly defined, and carried out through a formal process.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile organisations aren\u2019t required to implement all 114 Annex A controls, it\nis important to select and implement the controls that best align with your\norganisation\u2019s needs and goals.\n\nAnnex A.12 outlines best practices for operations security through 14\npotential controls that ensure sensitive information is not leaked, stolen or\ndamaged. A.12 covers vital aspects of the risk-management **-based**  ISO\n27001 framework, designed to strengthen infosec practices, protecting\ninformation from external threats.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.12-operations-security", "title": "Annex A.12 Operations Security - DataGuard", "description": "Learn about Annex A.12 in detail, why it\u2019s necessary for your organisation, and take a look at each of the 14 requirements covered in this Annex.\n", "language": "en-gb"}, "type": "Document"}
{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A.13?**\n\nAnnex A.13 communications security is a broad subject that includes hardware,\nsoftware, procedures and personnel which safeguard the transfer of information\nin storage, over transmission lines and via radio waves.\n\nHardware, software, procedures and personnel include components such as:\n\n  * **Hardware**  \nThe physical components of a system (e.g., computers, printers and fax\nmachines) that house equipment or components that process data into\ninformation.\n\n  * **Software**  \nPrograms or operating systems used to operate these devices; examples include\nword processing applications like Microsoft Word or graphic design programs\nsuch as Adobe Illustrator.\n\n  * **Procedures**  \nRules established by an organisation to provide guidelines for its employees\nabout how work should be performed within an organisational context. Examples\ninclude password protection policies to protect sensitive data files from\nunauthorised access or encryption algorithms used during transmission of\nconfidential documents across unsecure networks.\n\n  * **Personnel**  \nHuman resources working within organisations whose actions affect its overall\nsecurity policy. Examples include employees who may unintentionally leak\nsensitive information about their employer through social media posts\ncontaining exclusive information about their company's clients' financial\ntransactions.\n\nIt's recommended that Annex A.13 is used in conjunction with other security\nmeasures and guidance, such as the Annex A controls along with the ISMS.\n\n## **What is communications security?**\n\nCommunications security is a part of information security, which in turn is a\ncomponent of IT security. Information security refers to the set of policies\nand processes designed to ensure that data remains secure throughout its\nlifecycle.\n\nProtecting networks, computers, as well as smartphones against cyber threats\nis the focus of data privacy. Therefore, when a system accomplishes its goals\nwithout causing any complications for its users, it is considered effective.\n\nAnnex A.13 also applies to any third-party suppliers and customers that\ninteract with the organisation's IT systems. This includes websites, e-Mail,\ndata storage and processing facilities.\n\n## **Why is communications security important?**\n\nIn a business context communications security helps prevent risk of the\nfollowing types of damages:\n\n    * **Financial loss:** The risk of unauthorised disclosure, modification, destruction or misuse of information would result in tangible loss such as theft or fraud.\n    * **Damage to reputation:** The risk of harm to your company's image, brand and/or customer loyalty due to non-compliance with security regulations and/or poor management practices. This can lead to loss of customers and contracts as well as a decrease in revenue and profits.\n    * **Loss of public trust:** The risk of sensitive information being disclosed inappropriately due to insufficient security controls.\n\n\n\n## **What are the Annex A.13 controls?**\n\n### **A.13.1 Network Security Management**\n\nProtecting data in networks and the information processing facilities that\nenable them is the objective of this Annex. Two of the most important things\nto focus on in this section are the management of network security and the\nmaintenance of data integrity and availability.\n\n#### **A.13.1.1 Network controls**\n\nA company's network must safeguard itself against intrusions, interceptions,\nand other forms of data manipulation techniques. In order to protect your firm\nfrom external threats, you will need to have an in-depth understanding about\nyour network's requirements, dangers, and assets. When developing a security\npolicy, you should consider both internal and external threats.\n\nControls relevant to the situation include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Firewalls and preventive systems\n  * Lists of access controls \n  * Connection controls\n  * End point verifications\n  * The separation of networks\n\n#### **A.13.1.2 Security of network services**\n\nEstablishing security measures to safeguard data sent across a network should\nbe completed according to the results of the risk assessment. Security\nstandards, business requirements, and possible risks should all be considered\nwhen drafting network service agreements.\n\n#### **A.13.1.3 Segregation in networks**\n\nThere should be separate systems in place for various sorts of users and\ninformation networks. Sections for public, departmental, critical and\nmanagement access should all be maintained separately. Instead of depending on\none another, it is safer to have each service handle its own procedures.\n\n### **A.13.2 Information transfer control**\n\nThis ensures the safety of any data sent to and received from within and\noutside the company.\n\n#### **A.13.2.1 Information transfer policies and procedures**\n\nYou'll need policies to keep data safe as it travels across your network. A\nvariety of standards should be supported, and policies and procedures for the\ntransfer of these risks must be in place.\n\n#### **A.13.2.2 Agreements on information transfer**\n\nYour company's agreements with outside representatives should explicitly state\nthat any data transmitted or received must be kept secret and intact.\nProtecting both physical and digital copies of information should be done in\naccordance with the agreement's specific categorisation standards.\n\n#### **A.13.2.3 Electronic messaging**\n\nDigital messaging systems must be safeguarded from cyber threats and connected\nto policy criteria about suitable e-messaging for different types of content.\nIdentity theft and fraud may occur if sensitive financial information is sent\nover electronic communication channels without appropriate security safeguards\nin place. In this, encryption, masked communication, and monitoring must all\nbe incorporated.\n\n#### **A.13.2.4 Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements**\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are critical when it comes to protecting data.\n\nGenerally, nondisclosure agreements may be divided into the following groups:\n\n  * Unilateral\n  * Bilateral/ Multilateral\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIt is important to remember that the communications security depends on\nseveral factors, including the type of equipment you use and how you send\nmessages. If in doubt, always follow best practice guidelines provided by your\norganisation. Annex A.13 is critical to your organisation's implementation of\nISO 27001 since it demonstrates good security practices and gives you a\ncompetitive advantage.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.13-communications-security/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.13 - Communications Security - DataGuard", "description": "Annex A.13 is a critical component in preventing unauthorized access and modifications to your ISMS.

{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A.14?**\n\nAnnex A.14 can be seen as a control that not only oversees procurement\nprocesses for new systems, but also provides criteria for new systems that can\nbe tested before going live. This control is also designed to ensure that new\nsystems' security requirements are assessed, established, and measured.\n\nIt is common for an organisation to identify the functional and non-functional\nrequirements of a new system when developing a new product. Annex A.14\noutlines the organisation's expectations for the system's appearance and\ncapabilities. Before purchasing or creating a system, the organisation can\nverify that it meets the organisation's needs by comparing it to the system's\nspecifications. This is the time to identify what kind of security measures\nyou'll need.\n\nAnnex A.14 has three umbrella controls, each with their own objective to\nfacilitate a successful ISMS and obtain ISO 27001 certification.\n\n## **What is the objective of Annex A.14?**\n\nOverall, Annex A.14 is about incorporating information security into each\nstage of a system\u2019s life cycle. To do this, each control offers the following\nobjectives:\n\n### **Annex A.14.1: Security requirements of information systems**\n\nAn important goal of this Annex A area is that information security be\nintegrated through the lifecycle of the system. Additionally, this includes\nthe standards for information systems that provide services across public\nnetworks.\n\nTherefore, you need to see if information security is embedded into each and\nevery step in all of your systems.\n\n### **Annex A.14.2: Security in development and support processes**\n\nSection 2's goal is to make sure the creation of all of your information\nsystems takes security into consideration. System design and development is a\nconstant part of your organisation\u2019s work. As a result, it will take some time\nfor your organisation to work through this clause.\n\nYour procedures must be mapped from the beginning of development to the end of\nrelease. After that, look for any weak spots in the security system.\n\nSome areas that you may need to cover according to the standard are:\n\n  * Secure development policy\n  * System change control procedures\n  * Technical review of applications after operating platform changes\n  * Restrictions on changes to software packages\n  * Secure system engineering principles\n  * Secure development environment\n  * Outsourced development\n  * System security testing\n  * System acceptance testing\n\n### **Annex A.14.3: Test data**\n\nThe goal of the third and final clause is to ensure the protection of data\nused for testing.\n\n\n\n## **What is system acquisition development and maintenance?**\n\nInformation systems are an important organisational asset because of the\nbenefits they provide and the high expenditures they incur. Organisations must\nprepare for the long term when purchasing information systems and services\nthat support their business objectives. On the basis of long-term corporate\nstrategies and the needs of everyone from data employees to the CEO, critical\napplications and project priorities are established.\n\nA specific information system has to be acquired once the necessity for it has\nbeen recognised. In most cases, this is done within the context of the\norganisation\u2018s information systems architecture. Either external sourcing or\ninternal development or modification can be used to obtain information\nsystems. Once the need for a specific system has been recognised, system\ndevelopment can begin.\n\nSystem development is the process of defining, creating, testing, and\nimplementing a new software application or programme. Customised solutions\nmight be built in-house or purchased from a third-party developer. During\nsystem development, you need to integrate security into every stage, from\nproject inception to deployment and disposal. It is the most effective\nstrategy to safeguard data and information systems.\n\nDuring the system\u2019s life, it needs to be maintained constantly. The purpose of\nthe maintenance process is to sustain the capability of a system to provide a\nservice. This process monitors the system's capability to deliver services,\nrecords problems for analysis, takes corrective, adaptive, perfective, and\npreventive actions, and confirms restored capability.\n\nNow that you have an understanding of what Annex A.14 is about, let\u2019s take a\nlook at its individual controls.\n\n## **What are the Annex A.14 controls?**\n\nAnnex A.14 has 13 controls in place to assist with the acquisition,\ndevelopment and maintenance of your information security system. They are:\n\n### **A.14.1.1 Information Security Requirements Analysis & Specification**\n\nA risk assessment is essential when developing new systems or making changes\nto existing ones to determine the business requirements for security measures.\nThis should be implemented before the selection of a solution or the beginning\nof the development of a solution. Security considerations should begin at the\nearliest possible moment to ensure that relevant requirements are recognised\nbefore the selection process begins.\n\nAt each stage of the project lifecycle, the auditor will be looking to ensure\nthat security considerations are being taken into account. Prior to the\nselection or development process beginning, they also expect to see\nconsideration given to confidentiality, honesty, and availability.\n\n### **A.14.1.2 Securing Application Services on Public Networks**\n\nThe information in application services travelling over public networks must\nbe protected from fraud, contract dispute, and unauthorised disclosure and\nchange. For services supplied through a public network like the internet, risk\nlevels and business requirements for protecting information must be\nunderstood. Again, privacy, integrity, and availability are key.\n\nWhen financial transactions or sensitive personal information are part of a\nservice, security is extremely crucial to reduce the risk of fraud. GDPR\nrequirements for encryption and other measures must be the minimum\nrequirements. When functioning, systems must be regularly monitored for\nattacks or unwanted activities. The auditor looks for \"how secure\" application\nservices over public networks need to be, depending on risk assessment and\nlegal, regulatory, and contractual criteria.\n\n### **A.14.1.3 Protecting Application Services Transactions**\n\nUnauthorised message change and transmission, unauthorised message disclosure,\nunauthorised message duplication, and replay are all possible outcomes of\nunprotected application service transactions. Application service transactions\nmay be more secure if they are subject to additional safeguards (not\nnecessarily just financial transactions). Secure procedures, such as the use\nof electronic signatures and encryption, can also be considered. These\ntransactions also require constant monitoring in real-time.\n\n### **A.14.2.1 Secure Development Policy**\n\nThe development of software and systems within an organisation should be\ngoverned by a set of guidelines. Develop and implement systems and system\nimprovements in an environment where security-conscious coding and development\ntechniques are encouraged by adopting a secure development policy.\n\nPolicies that are compliant handle:\n\n  * Security checkpoints throughout development,\n  * Secure repositories,\n  * Security in version control,\n  * Application security knowledge and \n  * Developers' capacity to prevent vulnerabilities and detect and fix them when they do occur.\n\nAuditors want to know that security considerations are in line with the risk\nof systems being built or updated. They also want to know if employees\ninvolved in development are aware of the importance of including security\nconcerns at every stage in their work processes.\n\n### **A.14.2.2 System Change Control Procedures**\n\nChanges to systems in the development lifecycle need rigorous change control\nprocedures. System change control should correspond with and assist\noperational change control. Formal change management practices limit the\npossibility of unintentional or deliberate vulnerabilities that could\ncompromise systems once the changes are made. In system change control, the\nsystem owner must know what changes are performed, why, and by whom. They must\nensure their systems aren't compromised by poor or malicious development.\n\nTherefore, they should specify the rules for authorisation and pre-live\ntesting and validation. Audit logs must show accurate change procedures used.\nISO 27002 covers numerous areas of change control, from simple documentation\nthrough deployment time to avoid negative business impact. Like other A.14\ncontrols, this one follows A.12.1.2's defined processes.\n\n### **A.14.2.3 Technical Review of Applications After Operating Platform\nChanges**\n\nWhen operating systems are changed, essential business applications must be\nexamined and verified to ensure that there is no negative impact on the\norganisation's operations or security. It's not uncommon for some applications\nto experience compatibility issues after a switch to a new operating system\nplatform. As a result, it's necessary to evaluate operating system updates in\na development or testing environment before implementing them in production.\nControl and testing procedures for operating system modifications should\nadhere to accepted change management practices.\n\n### **A.14.2.4 Restrictions on Changes to Software Packages**\n\nDiscouragement, restriction, and stringent control are all requirements for\nsoftware package modifications. Packages from third-party vendors are created\nwith a focus on broad distribution rather than customisation. Customisation is\ntypically restricted to features included in a given package and is not\navailable outside of it. Changes can be made more easily when using open-\nsource software, but this must be restricted and controlled so that they do\nnot have a negative influence on the product's internal integrity or security.\n\n### **A.14.2.5 Secure System Engineering Principles**\n\nEstablishing, documenting and implementing secure systems engineering\nprinciples is critical to the success of any information system installation.\nAt both a generic and platform-specific level, principles of secure software\nengineering exist. Consideration should be given to the selection and use of\nthese principles wherever development is taking place, and they should be\ndocumented and mandated. To ensure that the usage of system engineering\nprinciples is properly balanced against recognised risks, the auditor is going\nto be searching for evidence to back up the decisions made.\n\n### **A.14.2.6 Secure Development Environment**\n\nIt's critical for organisations to have safe development environments that\ncover the full system lifecycle, from the initial design phase through final\ndeployment. To prevent the malicious or unintentional development and updating\nof code that could affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability,\ndevelopment environments must be safeguarded. Risk assessment, business\nrequirements, and other internal and external requirements, such as\nlegislation, regulation, contractual agreement, or policies, should be used to\nestablish the level of protection needed. Development environments should take\nextra precautions to safeguard any live data that may be there.\n\n### **A.14.2.7 Outsourced Development**\n\nOutsourced system development must be overseen and monitored by the\norganisation. When system and software development is contracted out to a\nthird party, the security criteria must be clearly stated in the contract or\nagreement that is connected to the project. Annex A.15.1 and A.13.2.4 for\nnondisclosure and confidentiality are crucial here.\n\nThe auditor checks to see if there is evidence of due diligence undertaken\nbefore, during, and after the engagement of the outsource partner, including\nconsideration of provisions for information security when outsourcing is\nutilised.\n\n### **A.14.2.8 System Security Testing**\n\nDuring the course of development, it is essential to test the system's\nsecurity features. When it comes to any new development, security testing must\nbe carried out and signed off by an appropriate security authority. Expected\nresults of a security test should be documented prior to testing, and they\nshould be based on the company's security requirements. The auditor will be\nlooking for evidence that any security-relevant development has undergone\nsecurity-specific testing.\n\n### **A.14.2.9 System Acceptance Testing**\n\nThere must be procedures in place for testing and approving new systems,\nupdates, and new versions of existing ones. Prior to conducting any acceptance\ntesting, the tests and the criteria for demonstrating that a test was\nsuccessful should be defined based on business needs. Security testing should\nalso be a part of the acceptance testing process. Security acceptance testing\nshould be included in all acceptance testing criteria and procedures according\nto the auditor's requirements.\n\n### **A.14.3.1 Protection of Test Data**\n\nIt is imperative that test data be carefully chosen, preserved, and monitored.\nIdeally, test data should be created in a generic form that has no connection\nto the live system's data. However, it is widely accepted that real-world data\nis typically necessary for accurate testing. Anonymised as much as feasible,\ncarefully picked, and securely erased when testing is over. The use of real-\ntime data must be pre-approved, logged, and monitored. When testing with live\ndata, the auditor will be looking for mechanisms in place to ensure the\nsecurity of that data.\n\n## **Why is system acquisition development and maintenance important for your\norganisation?**\n\nAs society progresses further into a digitised era, acquiring, developing and\nmaintaining systems for information security is of utmost importance. Business\nInformation System makes it simple to store operational data, revision\nhistories, communication records and documents. Further, as cyber attacks and\ncybercrime become more prevalent, a well maintained information system with\nsecurity controls helps to protect the information from various threats.\n\nAs an organisation, customer and supplier trust is key to business operations.\nApplying the controls of Annex A.14 will further establish strong bonds of\ntrust and increase your reputation as a safe service provider.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nInformation security is an integral part of an information system\u2019s life\ncycle. From making the decision to acquire a new system, to developing and\nmaintaining said system, you should look at applying InfoSec controls along\nthe journey. It helps establish safer business practices and protect your\nvaluable information.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.14-system-acquisition-development-and-maintenance/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.14 - system acquisition development and maintenance", "description": "Annex A.14 is an important strategy to implement security controls throughout the entire lifespan of your ISMS.

{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A.15?**\n\nOnce your organisation\u2019s information is shared with a supplier, you may no\nlonger have direct control over it, regardless of its sensitivity or worth. As\na result, all external suppliers must be subject to suitable technological and\ncontractual controls and mitigation mechanisms. This is where Annex A.15 comes\nin.\n\nAnnex A.15 covers everything from securing information handled by external\nsuppliers to examining the supplier's disaster recovery processes. It also\ncovers the development of agreements for data return in the event of contract\ntermination or unexpected closure.\n\nEach control of Annex A.15 has an objective to bring your organisation closer\nto ISO certification. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\n## **What is the objective of Annex A.15?**\n\nAnnex A.15 is all about controlling and managing the risks connected with the\nsupplier-organisation relationship to guarantee that your operations and your\ncustomers' information stays secure. To do this Annex A.15 provides the\nfollowing 2 major controls:\n\n### **Annex A.15.1: Information security in supplier relationships**\n\nAnnex A.15.1 focuses on the protection of organisation information in supplier\npartnerships. In this case, the goal is to protect the organisation\u2019s assets\nthat are accessible to its suppliers.\n\nIt is recommended that you additionally evaluate other critical relationships\nhere, such as partners if they are not suppliers but have an impact on your\nassets that may not be covered by a contract alone. To acquire ISO 27001\ncertification, this is an essential aspect of the information security\nmanagement system (ISMS).\n\n### **Annex A.15.2: Supplier service delivery management**\n\nThe goal of this control is to ensure that the degree of information security\nand service delivery agreed upon with suppliers is maintained.\n\nIt is critical to ensure that service providers meet the requirements of\nthird-party contracts as soon as operations begin. This can include everything\nfrom the service's availability to more specific details, such as the service\nprovider's security policies. A systematic assessment of services and controls\nis also required, as well as a close examination of service reports provided\nby third parties in order to verify that the data they contain is adequate and\nrelevant.\n\nBefore diving into the specific controls of each annex, the next section helps\nyou understand what supplier relationships are.\n\n## **What are supplier relationships in ISO 27001?**\n\nSupplier relationships in ISO 27001 may sometimes be confused with the more\npopular term, \u2018 _Supplier Relationship Management_ \u2019. However, these two are\nnot the same. Under the ISO standard, managing supplier relationships means\nestablishing and maintaining rules that keep shared information safe.\n\nSuppliers are the ones who handle your organisation\u2019s sensitive information\nthe most frequently in supplier relationships. These connections also include\nbusiness partners and, on occasion, customers.\n\nDuring operations that could range from outsourcing software development to\nsharing research on a new product, supplier relationship norms and regulations\nmust be defined. When obtaining new clients, they may want access to your\nsensitive data for auditing purposes. These are a few examples of when\nsupplier relationship information security is required.\n\n\n\n## **What are the Annex A.15 controls?**\n\nOnce you are familiar with the concept of supplier relationships, you need to\nidentify and implement the information security controls that best fit your\nbusiness. The 5 controls of Annex A.15 are:\n\n### **A.15.1.1: Information security policy for supplier relationships**\n\nIt is essential that the supplier agrees to and documents information security\nrequirements relating to the risk of access by suppliers to the organisation's\nassets. The risk assessment should be done whenever any company wishes to\ngrant access to its supplier.\n\nOrganisations need to define and incorporate security information controls in\ntheir policies. These include:\n\n  * Establishing which suppliers, such as those providing information technology (IT) and finance are readily available to the business.\n  * Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the information shared by both parties with each other.\n  * Ensuring that all parties have access to information or processes in the event of a disaster. There must be a strategy for recovery and contingency.\n  * Educating the personnel of the organisation involved in acquisitions about the related policies, processes, and procedures.\n  * Education on the acceptable rules of engagement and behaviour depending on provider type and amount of supplier access to the system. \n  * Education on the rules of handling information of the organisation for employees of those who deal with staff of suppliers.\n  * Signing a legal contract to safeguard the integrity of the connection.\n\n### **A.15.1.2: Addressing security within supplier agreements**\n\nThe information security requirements for any suppliers who see, process,\nstore, communicate, or deliver IT infrastructure component information for the\norganisation should be stated and agreed upon. This section shows how to\ndefine and accept your responsibilities, as well as record them securely under\nan applicable policy. This policy may include:\n\n  * The task at hand and the extent to which it extends\n  * Classification of sensitive data\n  * Requirements imposed by law and regulation\n  * Reports and evaluations\n  * Confidentiality\n  * Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)\n  * Incident management\n  * Subcontractors' obligations\n  * Screening of employees\n\nThis agreement also grants the organisation sole authority to audit the\nsupplier and its subcontractors.\n\n### **A.15.1.3: Information and communication technology supply chain**\n\nSupplier agreements include requirements to reduce the security risks\nconnected with the IT services and the product supply chain. This means that\nif there's a possibility of a data breach, the supplier and contractor will\nhave to get in touch. Suppliers are required to describe how they dealt with\nminor risks, as well as how they assured the risk was eradicated, even if it\nis a small risk. Controlling supplier relations effectively requires using\ncrucial services to track the supply chain's history and its point of origin.\n\n### **A.15.2.1: Monitoring and review of supplier services**\n\nSupplier service delivery should be monitored, reviewed, and audited on a\nregular basis by companies. Information security terms and conditions must be\nfollowed and information security incidents and problems must be effectively\nhandled through regular monitoring and assessment of service providers. This\nincludes a process of:\n\n  * Verification of agreement compliance through service level monitoring.\n  * Regularly reviewing service reports from the supplier.\n  * Performing audits of the supplier and following-up on reported problems and, if possible, use the findings of independent auditors to help resolve issues.\n  * Providing and reviewing information on safety occurrences as specified in agreements and any applicable standards and procedures.\n  * Examining the audit and information security reports, operational issues, failures, fault-tracking, and service-related disturbances that manufacturers have reported on in the past.\n\n### **A.15.2.2: Managing changes to supplier services**\n\nMaintaining and upgrading existing information security policies, procedures,\nand controls is a key component of a well-managed control system. It considers\nthe importance of business information, the nature of the change, the types of\nsuppliers affected, the systems and procedures involved, and a reevaluation of\nrisks.\n\nThe closeness of the relationship and the organisation's ability to influence\nor manage the supplier should also be taken into account when making changes\nto suppliers' services.\n\n## **Why are supplier relationships important for your organisation?**\n\nAn organisation with a well-defined ISMS can protect its supply chain\nrelationships as well as its corporate reputation. When your current suppliers\nunderstand that you have a solid defence against information security threats,\nthey may look forward to long-term partnerships with your organisation.\nAdditionally, assuring the protection of their vital confidential information\nwill help your company's reputation inside the industrial supply chain.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWhen planning for ISO 27001 certification, having good supplier relationships\nproves to auditors that you understand how to safeguard critical information\nwith external parties. Taking the necessary steps to effectively implement\nthese controls also improves your organisation's reputation in the perspective\nof potential customers and business partners.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.15-supplier-relationships/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.15 - Supplier Relationships - DataGuard", "description": "Annex A 15 is a comprehensive guide to building and maintaining supplier relationships.

{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A 16?**\n\nAnnex A.16 outlines the requirements for managing information security\nincidents, and organisations of all types and sizes should familiarise\nthemselves with the best practices for preventing and responding to security\nincidents. Before we look at these individual requirements, it's important to\nunderstand what qualifies as information security incidents, and why incident\nmanagement is important for your organisation.\n\n## **What are information security incidents?**\n\nAny action that threatens the security of information technology operations or\nviolates established responsible use policies can be considered as an\ninformation security incident.\n\nThese threats may be suspected, successful or attempted, and may cause risk of\nunauthorised access, release, use, loss, damage, breach or alteration of\ninformation. Some examples of such incidents are:\n\n  * Unauthorised changes to installed software\n  * Compromise of physical and environmental security, such as damage of company devices\n  * Breach of accounts or disclosure of passwords and cryptographic keys\n\nWhile incidents are unlikely to be reported unless they are serious (capable\nof causing harm), it is important to develop an airtight incident management\nprogram for the following reasons.\n\n\n\n## **Why is information security incident management important?**\n\n  \nInformation security incidents are inevitable, and hackers and other malicious\nparties stand to gain from these incidents. Therefore, incident management is\nnecessary to reduce the impact of incidents and prevent them from reoccurring\nin the future.\n\nEffective information security programs consider all facets of an organisation\nand show you where its weaknesses lie. The requirements of information\nsecurity incident management fall under 7 key areas which are explored in\ndetail below.\n\n## **What are the Annex A.16 controls?**\n\n  \nAnnex A.16 comprises 7 controls focused on information security incident\nmanagement. These controls outline the requirements for identifying and\nmanaging information security weaknesses, events and incidents.\n\n### **A.16.1 Management of information security incidents, events and\nweaknesses**\n\nThe objective of A.16.1 is to ensure your organisation maintains a sound\napproach to managing and reporting information security incidents, such as\nbreaches, unauthorised disclosure, destruction or loss of information, among\nothers.  \n\n  * **A.16.1.1 Responsibilities & Procedures**  \n  \nPrompt and effective action must be taken in the event of a security incident.\nTo ensure this, management responsibilities and procedures should be\nestablished. When establishing management responsibilities and developing\ninformation security procedures, the following actions should be considered:\n\n  * Planning and preparing incident response\n  * Monitoring, detecting, analysing and reporting information security events\n  * Logging incident management activities\n  * Handling forensic evidence\n  * Assessing and deciding on information security events and weaknesses\n  * Responding to a security incident, both internally and externally\n\nIt is important that all procedures ensure that information security incidents\nare handled by competent personnel, and that appropriate points of contact,\nboth within and outside of the organisation, are identified and established\nfor the handling of information security issues.\n\nReporting procedures should include the following:\n\n  * Reporting forms that support the reporting action and log all necessary actions in the event of an information security event\n  * Next steps to be followed in the event of an information security event\n  * The formal disciplinary process to be followed in the case of employees who commit security breaches\n  * An organised feedback process to ensure that parties concerned are updated on the progress and results of reported information security events\n\nAll those responsible for information security incident management must be\nmade aware of these processes, and all processes must be agreed upon with\nmanagement.\n\n  * **A.16.1.2 Reporting Information Security Events**  \n  \nInformation security incidents should be reported, as and when they occur or\nas early as possible, through appropriate management channels. All parties\nconcerned should be made aware of their reporting responsibilities, reporting\nprocedures and points of contact in the event an information security incident\noccurs.  \n  \n\n  * **A.16.1.3 Reporting Information Security Weaknesses**  \n  \nAll parties who have access to and use the organisation\u2019s information systems\nand services are required to take note of and report any observed or suspected\nweaknesses and incidents. The reporting procedure and mechanism should be\neasily accessible so parties may report weaknesses to the established point of\ncontact as quickly as possible, with the objective of preventing incidents\nfrom occurring.  \n  \n\n  * **A.16.1.4 Assessment of & Decision on Information Security Events** **  \n** **  \n**Information security events require assessment before being classified as\n\u201cincidents\u201d. Established points of contact must evaluate information security\nevents using an agreed-upon classification scale to assess the impact and\nextent of the event, and whether it qualifies as a security incident. The\nresults of this assessment must be recorded for future reference and\nverification purposes. In summary, this process can be broken down into the\nfollowing stages:\n\n  1. Identification, prioritisation and assessment\n  2. Containment\n  3. Investigation/ \u201croot cause\u201d analysis \n  4. Response\n  5. Follow up  \n  \n\n  * **A.16.1.5 Response to Information Security Incidents** **  \n** **  \n**The response to an information security incident should be in accordance\nwith documented procedures. A nominated point of contact, and other relevant\ninternal or external parties, should respond to information security\nincidents.  \n  \nThe following should be done as part of the response:\n\n  * Promptly collecting evidence\n  * Conducting information security forensics analysis\n  * Escalating incidents as required\n  * Logging all response activities for future analysis\n  * Communicating the details of information security incident to relevant parties, both internal and external\n  * Addressing any contributing or causative information security weaknesses\n  * Formally closing and recording the incident once completely addressed and actioned\n  * Analysing the incident to identify the source  \n  \n\n  * **A.16.1.6 Learning from Information Security Incidents** **  \n** **  \n**Once incidents are resolved, all related knowledge must be used to ensure\nprevention of future incidents. The types, volumes, and costs of information\nsecurity incidents must be quantified and monitored with effective mechanisms.\nThrough these evaluations, resulting information should be utilised\neffectively to identify and prevent recurring or high-impact incidents.  \n  \n\n  * **A.16.1.7 Collection of Evidence** **  \n** **  \n**Procedures are required for identifying, collecting, acquiring, and\npreserving information. This evidence can be used to decide on disciplinary\nand/or legal action, and internal procedures should take the following into\naccount:\n\n  * Chain of custody\n  * Safety of evidence\n  * Safety of personnel\n  * Roles and responsibilities of personnel involved\n  * Competency of personnel\n  * Documentation\n  * BBriefing\n\nWhenever possible, the value of evidence should be strengthened with\ncertification or other relevant supporting resources.  \n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAnnex A controls comprise 114 individual controls that aren\u2019t mandatory, but\ncan be selected according to your organisation\u2019s information security\nobjectives.\n\nIn summary, Annex A.16 covers the importance of information security incident\nmanagement through 7 controls that outline procedure development, reporting\nmechanisms and response.

{"page_content": "## **What is Annex A.17?**\n\nAnnex A.17 outlines the requirements for an organisation's business continuity\nmanagement in relation to its information security aspects. This ensures that\nany operations that rely on data and systems can be resumed during disaster\nrecovery. So, what exactly is business continuity management?\n\n## **What is Business Continuity Management?**\n\nBusiness continuity management \u2013 or planning \u2013 is the process of identifying\nreal or potential threats and contingency measures to handle disruptions to\nnormal business processes. This includes an organisation\u2019s information\nsecurity aspects, putting procedures in place to ensure the swift recovery of\nsystems and data. Next, let us understand the importance of business\ncontinuity management and how it applies to your organisation.\n\n## **Why is Business Continuity Management important for your organisation?**\n\nIn the event of unavoidable or unexpected disruptions to business operations,\neffective business continuity planning ensures that your organisation is able\nto recover and regain full functionality as rapidly as possible, and minimise\nthe impact of such disruptions. This level of planning requires risk\nassessment and analysis, and measures must be taken to protect the integrity,\navailability and confidentiality of information in accordance with all\nrelevant regulations, legislature and policies.\n\n\n\n## **What are the Annex A.17 controls?**\n\nAnnex A.17 comprises 4 controls across two subsets aimed at ensuring, planning\nand implementing information security continuity. These controls are as\nfollows:\n\n### **A.17.1 Information Security Continuity**\n\nA.17.1 states policies that ensure the continuity of information security\nshould be considered a part of and integrated into the organisation\u2019s business\ncontinuity management processes.\n\n  * #### **A.17.1.1 Planning Information Security Continuity**\n\nWhen faced with disruptions and adverse circumstances, organisations must\ndetermine their requirements for the continuity of information security during\nand after the event.\n\n\n\nAn effectively managed ISMS may already have control mechanisms in place that\nreduce the need for an A.17 based disaster management plan. Even so, a\ndetailed plan must be documented; one that ensures infosec continuity and\nassumes existing infosec requirements remain the same across normal and\nadverse conditions. Alternatively, a risk analysis may be conducted to\nidentify new information security requirements relevant to the disruption or\nadverse situation at hand.\n\n  * **A.17.1.2 Implementing Information Security Continuity**  \n  \nOnce infosec continuity requirements have been identified, the organisation\nmust implement policies and controls to facilitate the satisfaction of these\nrequirements. All aspects of work (parties responsible, activities etc.) must\nbe clearly defined along with an appropriate escalation procedure and points\nof contact, to ensure swift resolution and return to normal operations.\n\n  * **A.17.1.3 Verify, Review & Evaluate Information Security Continuity**  \n  \n\nFrom time to time, the control measures in place must be evaluated for\nappropriateness and effectiveness. They must be tested to ensure that they are\nmaintained in accordance with organisational changes and risk-based\nrequirements. The results of testing must be logged for future review by\nauditors.\n\n\n\n### **A.17.2 Redundancies**\n\nThe objective of A.17.2 is to ensure the availability of information\nprocessing facilities.\n\n  * **A.17.2.1 Availability of Information Processing Facilities**  \n  \n\nRedundancy refers to the availability of a \u201cbackup\u201d (usually in a different\nformat) that ensures the survival of data in the event of failure. Typically,\nredundant items are duplicate pieces of hardware and must be tested at\nintervals to guarantee they can be relied on in emergency situations. They\nmust also be afforded, at least, the same level of security as their\nprimaries.\n\nPeriodic testing of redundant items must be documented for audit purposes.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe Annex A Controls list ensures that, if implemented well, reduces the need\nfor a business continuity plan. Although an ISO 27001 compliant ISMS with\neffective risk-prevention measures is ideal, an organisation may occasionally\nfind itself in need of A.17 contingencies.", "metadata": {"source": "https://www.dataguard.co.uk/blog/iso-27001-annex-a.17-information-security-aspects-of-business-continuity-management/", "title": "ISO 27001 - Annex A.17 and business continuity management", "description": "Annex A 17 guides the infosec measures included in an organisation's business continuity management plan.

These requirements cover the installation of software,\ntransference of information, encryption needs and intellectual property\nrights, to name a few, and requires individuals to assume responsibility for\nthe protection of confidential information.\n\nIt is important to understand what Compliance means in relation to the ISO\n27001 standard of information security, and what Annex A.18 entails.\n\n## What is Compliance?\n\nCompliance, as outlined in Annex A.18 of the Annex A controls, requires that\nan organisation adheres to all relevant control objectives, controls,\npolicies, processes, and procedures, whether they be legal, regulatory,\ncontractual or self-imposed, to ensure that information security is enforced\nand managed.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at why proper compliance should matter to you and your\norganisation.\n\n## Why is Compliance important for your organisation?\n\nNetwork sharing and the installation of softwares can provide access to\nhackers, making personally identifiable information and confidential business\nrecords vulnerable to unauthorised disclosure, loss and falsification.\nIdentifying and maintaining a strict compliance framework can prevent the\nunauthorised access of an organisation\u2019s diverse information sets.\n\n\n\n## **What are the Annex A.18 controls?**\n\nAnnex A.18 comprises 8 controls focused on both external and internal\ncompliance. This section covers how an organisation should identify and comply\nwith relevant legislation, abide by intellectual property laws and licensing\nrequirements, protect business records and personally identifiable information\nand regularly review compliance with existing information security practices.\n\n  * ### **A.18.1 Compliance with legal and contractual requirements**\n\nThe objective of Annex A.18.1 is to ensure your organisation\u2019s information\nsystems comply with any and all infosec-related obligations, be it laws,\nregulations or contracts.  \n\n  * **A.18.1.1 identification of applicable legislation and contractual requirements**  \n  \n **Control:** It is required that the organisation regularly identifies,\ndocuments and updates requirements along with the organisation\u2019s approach to\ncomplying with them.  \n **Implementation:** Individual obligations (i.e. the role of specific\nindividuals in complying with requirements) must be identified and documented.\nAll relevant legislatures should be identified and upheld even if business\noperations are carried out in another country.  \n  \n\n  * **A.18.1.2 Intellectual property rights**  \n  \n **Control:** All legislation surrounding intellectual property rights and\nproprietary licences must be upheld and complied with.  \nThe following must be considered before declaring any material as intellectual\nproperty in need of protection:\n\n  * Fair/legitimate use of software and information products must be recorded in a guideline\n  * Software must only be purchased from reputed sources to not risk corruption or breaches\n  * In case of intellectual property violations, disciplinary action must be taken with prior notice\n  * All assets must be registered along with their intellectual property rights requirements\n  * Evidence of licence ownership must be recorded\n  * If there is a set maximum number of users, controls must be implemented to ensure this number isn\u2019t exceeded\n  * Installed products and software must be reviewed for proof of sole licence\n  * Appropriate use/conditions of licences must be outlined and enforced via a policy document  \n  * Information/guidelines surrounding the disposal and transfer of information must be communicated in a strategy\n  * General terms and conditions of installed software and public networks must be complied with\n  * The replication, transformation and extraction of audio and video recordings must be restricted to what is permissible under copyright law\n  * Written media and documents may only be copied as deemed permissible by copyright law  \n  \n\n  * **A.18.1.3 Protection of records**  \n  \n **Control:** Organisational records should be protected from unauthorised\naccess and release, as well as loss, destruction and falsification, per all\nrelevant legislation.  \nImplementation: The organisation\u2019s classification scheme should dictate which\ndocuments require protection. Records should be categorised according to type,\nand with their retention periods, encryption details and allowed storage\nformats. Storage should account for the possible destruction of media if and\nwhen it is no longer needed.  \n  \n\n  * **A.18.1.4 Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information**  \n  \n **Control:** The protection and privacy of information must be stipulated in\nany relevant legislation, and upheld as such.  \n **Implementation:** A data policy must be developed and implemented that\noutlines the requirements for the privacy and protection of personally\nidentifiable information. All those who are involved in the processing of this\ninformation must be made aware of this policy.\n\nA privacy officer must be appointed to assume responsibility for the\nprotection of personally identifiable information and the guidance of\npersonnel in achieving this. Additionally, measures should be implemented to\nenforce the privacy and protection of personally identifiable information.\n\n  * **A.18.1.5 Regulation of cryptographic controls**  \n  \n **Control:** Cryptographic controls must be implemented following business\nrequirements.  \n  \nThe following must be considered when implementing cryptographic controls:\n\n  * The import and export of any hardware and software that are used to perform cryptographic functions must be restricted\n  * The import and export of any hardware and software that have cryptographic functions applied to them must be restricted\n  * The use of encryption must be restricted\n  * There must be defined methods of access for information protected by encryption hardware and software\n\nBefore information is transported (across countries/jurisdictional\nboundaries), legal advice must be sought to ensure compliance with country\nauthorities.\n\n  * ### **A.18.2 Information Security Reviews**\n\nThe objective of A.18.2 is to ensure that all infosec requirements are upheld\nand enforced following organisational policies and procedures.\n\n  * **A.18.2.1 Independent review of information security**  \n  \n **Control:** Internal measures must be taken to improve the organisation's\ninformation security management approach.

{"page_content": "Difference Between GDPR and ISO 27001\n\nMany countries around the world have begun to pass legislation that regulates how businesses can collect and use consumer data, and that imposes certain standards of privacy and security that companies must meet while in possession of that data.\n\nOne landmark piece of legislation arrived in 2018 when the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect. The GDPR applies to all member states of the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\nAdditional privacy regulations have emerged since then, and understanding what each one requires and whom it affects can be cumbersome. Today we want to bring some clarity to the discussion by explaining the difference between GDPR and ISO 27001.\n\nWhat Is GDPR?\nThe GDPR mandates that all companies doing business within the EU or that collect the data of EU citizens must comply with strict rules to protect that personal data. It encourages organizations to manage their data security in line with prescriptive best practices and requires compliance of data controllers (businesses that collect the data) and data processors (companies that process data on behalf of others).\n\nWhat Is ISO 27001?\nISO 27001, or ISO/IEC 27001, is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS) that organizations can adopt.\n\nISO 27001 was established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2005 and later revised in 2013 and 2017.\n\nThe standard includes requirements for creating, executing, managing, and improving a company’s information security management system. This ensures that organizations will secure their information assets and protect against data breaches.\n\nAll organizations that can meet the ISO 27001 specifications can seek certification from an accredited institution that will conduct an audit to ensure the organization’s compliance.\n\nHow Are ISO 27001 and GDPR Different?\nISO 27001 is a voluntary certification that requires organizations to take a risk-based approach to how they manage sensitive data. In contrast, the GDPR aims to protect the personal data of EU citizens, and compliance with the GDPR is mandatory for most organizations working in Europe or with EU citizens.\n\nBoth ISO 27001 and the GDPR do revolve around risk, and both direct organizations to identify certain risks and controls that can bring those risks to an acceptable level.\n\nRegarding personal data, ISO 27001 incorporates encryption as part of business continuity management as well as the capability to restore data when necessary, in a timely manner. Along similar lines, the GDPR views personal data as something that all organizations must strive to protect.\n\nWhere the two regulations differ are in their requirements. For example, the GDPR includes the right of a consumer to have his or her data removed, as well as the right to control how the data is shared with third parties (also known as data portability). ISO 27001 doesn’t directly include such provisions.\n\nDoes ISO 27001 Cover GDPR?\nThe two are similar, but not identical. Here are a few examples of where ISO 27001 and the GDPR overlap, where compliance with ISO 27001 can help an organization to meet GDPR standards.\n\nISO 27001 and GDPR both require breach notification, but at different levels.\nUnder both ISO 27001 and the GDPR, companies must notify supervisory authorities of a breach of personal data within 72 hours of discovering it. ISO 27001 also contains standards designed to assure that information security incidents are handled in a consistent way.\n\nThe main difference, however, is that the GDPR stipulates that consumers (or data subjects) be notified when the breach poses a high risk of infringing upon their individual rights.\n\nIncident management and infosec solutions like those offered by ZenGRC help organizations be better equipped to detect, report, and manage personal data incidents; and to maintain compliance with the GDPR.\n\nGDPR and ISO 27001 BOTH mandate all regulatory and contractual requirements to be laid out.\nTo obtain an ISO 27001 certification, organizations must make all legislative and contractual requirements related to their business and their customers available to auditors, so that the audit team can confirm compliance.\n\nGDPR similarly mandates that all statutory and contractual requirements be made available to ensure compliance.\n\nISO 27001 risk assessment can help organizations avoid GDPR fines\nThe monetary penalties associated with violating the cybersecurity and data processing requirements outlined in the GDPR can be up to 4 percent of an organization’s global revenue. With consequences so painfully high, companies can’t afford to neglect appropriate risk assessment.\n\nIn fact, the GDPR mandates data protection impact assessments, which require organizations to assess privacy risks and vulnerabilities. ISO 27001 requires that same sort of risk assessment too. Therefore, by gaining ISO 27001 certification, an organization can simultaneously assure compliance with GDPR and reduce the chance of costly fines.\n\nThe asset management requirements of ISO 27001 help to ensure compliance with GDPR\nISO 27001 treats personal data as information security assets. As such, those assets are subject to constraints around storage, length of storage, collection, and access. Those are also requirements of the GDPR.\n\nThe future of GDPR requirements indicate that privacy will be built into business processes in alignment with ISO 27001\nData privacy regulation is getting more complex, not less; with additional provisions and protections being added every year. Looking forward, businesses that want a strategic advantage over competitors will have to incorporate security standards into all aspects of their business.\n\nCompanies aiming to comply with ISO 27001 (and other ISO standards like ISO 27701 and ISO 27000) will be well prepared to meet those future expectations since the ISO standard is all about how to protect information assets-personal data or otherwise.\n\nConclusion\nThe GDPR mainly revolves around how personal data is collected, where ISO 27001 provides guidance about how data that has been collected can remain confidential and secure.\n\nFurthermore, GDPR’s main directive is to protect the right to privacy for individuals and gives consumers certain rights to see how data of theirs is collected, stored, and shared. ISO 27001, on the other hand, is concerned more with the security controls around data.", "metadata": {"source": "https://reciprocity.com/difference-between-gdpr-and-iso-27001/", "title": "Difference Between GDPR and ISO 27001", "description": "", "language": "en-gb"}, "type": "Document"}
